# Chrondle Gameplay Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive guide to Chrondle's game mechanics, hint system, and player experience design.

## üéÆ Core Game Loop

### Daily Puzzle Cycle
```
1. Player visits game ‚Üí Load daily puzzle
2. Read initial historical event
3. Enter year guess
4. Receive feedback + new hint
5. Repeat until correct or 6 attempts
6. Share results ‚Üí Wait for next day
```

### Game Session Flow
1. **Initialization**: Load or generate daily puzzle
2. **Progress Restoration**: Resume if already started today
3. **Gameplay**: Accept guesses and provide feedback
4. **Completion**: Show results and share options
5. **Persistence**: Save progress automatically

## üèÜ Winning Conditions

### Victory States
- **Guess 1/6**: Master historian! Perfect knowledge
- **Guess 2/6**: Excellent! Strong historical intuition  
- **Guess 3/6**: Good job! Solid reasoning
- **Guess 4/6**: Nice work! Used hints effectively
- **Guess 5/6**: Close call! Perseverance pays off
- **Guess 6/6**: Just made it! Never give up

### Failure State
- **X/6**: "So close!" - Show correct answer and all events

## üìÖ Daily Puzzle System

### Deterministic Selection
All players worldwide get the same puzzle each day through deterministic year selection:

```javascript
// Simplified algorithm
const daysSinceEpoch = Math.floor((today - EPOCH_START) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
const yearIndex = daysSinceEpoch % CURATED_YEARS.length;
const selectedYear = CURATED_YEARS[yearIndex];
```

### Curated Year Collection
**50+ historically significant years** chosen for:
- **Event richness**: Likelihood of 6+ significant events
- **Historical importance**: Major turning points in history
- **Educational value**: Learning opportunities across eras
- **Global relevance**: Events of worldwide significance

#### Era Distribution

### Midnight Reset
- **Local timezone**: Puzzle changes at player's midnight
- **Progress isolation**: Each day gets separate save slot
- **Consistency**: Same calculation method ensures global uniformity

## üß© Hint Progression System

### Progressive Difficulty Design
Events are strategically ordered from **most obscure to most recognizable** to create an optimal learning curve:

```
Hint 1 (Initial):     Most accessible event
Hint 2 (After guess): Most obscure event  
Hint 3 (After guess): Second most obscure
...
Hint 6 (Final):       Most famous/obvious event
```

### Event Recognizability Scoring

#### High-Recognition Keywords (10 points each)
```javascript
[
    // Space & Technology
    'moon', 'apollo', 'nasa', 'space', 'satellite',
    
    // Politics & Leadership  
    'president', 'king', 'queen', 'emperor', 'prime minister',
    
    // Conflict & Peace
    'war', 'peace', 'treaty', 'battle', 'revolution',
    
    // Major Events
    'independence', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'assassination',
    
    // Famous Figures
    'hitler', 'stalin', 'churchill', 'roosevelt', 'kennedy',
    'lincoln', 'washington', 'napoleon', 'caesar'
]
```

#### Medium-Recognition Keywords (5 points each)
```javascript
[
    // Actions & Events
    'battle', 'siege', 'died', 'born', 'elected', 'crowned',
    'signed', 'declared', 'defeated', 'conquered',
    
    // Exploration & Discovery
    'expedition', 'voyage', 'discovered', 'explored',
    
    // Construction & Creation
    'constructed', 'completed', 'built', 'founded',
    'established', 'created'
]
```

#### Length Modifiers
- **Short events** (< 50 chars): +5 points (concise = memorable)
- **Very short** (< 30 chars): +5 more points  
- **Long events** (> 100 chars): -5 points (verbose = obscure)

### Example Progression (1969)
```
Initial Hint:    "The Boeing 747 makes its first flight"
                 (Technical/specific - moderate recognition)

Guess 1 Wrong:   "The Internet precursor ARPANET is created"  
                 (Technical/obscure - low recognition)

Guess 2 Wrong:   "The Stonewall riots occur in New York"
                 (Cultural/specific - medium recognition)

Guess 3 Wrong:   "Richard Nixon becomes President"
                 (Political figure - high recognition)  

Guess 4 Wrong:   "Woodstock music festival takes place"
                 (Cultural icon - very high recognition)

Guess 5 Wrong:   "Apollo 11 lands on the Moon"
                 (Universally famous - maximum recognition)
```

## üéØ Input & Validation

### Year Format Support
- **AD Years**: Positive integers (1, 1066, 1969, 2024)
- **BC Years**: Negative integers (-776, -753, -44)
- **No Year Zero**: Historically accurate (1 BC ‚Üí 1 AD)

### Input Validation Rules
```javascript
const guess = parseInt(guessInput.value, 10);

// Invalid conditions
if (isNaN(guess)) return "Please enter a valid number";
if (guess === 0) return "Year 0 doesn't exist in history";
if (guess < -3000) return "Please enter a year after 3000 BC";
if (guess > currentYear) return "Please enter a year in the past";
```

### User Input Helpers
- **Placeholder text**: "Enter a year (e.g. 1969 AD or -776 for 776 BC)..."
- **Auto-focus**: Input field gets focus after each guess
- **Enter key**: Submits guess form
- **Clear on submit**: Input field cleared after valid guess

## üß≠ Feedback System

### Directional Indicators
Simple, clear guidance towards the correct year:

```javascript
const direction = guess < target ? '‚ñ≤ LATER' : '‚ñº EARLIER';
```

#### Visual Design
- **Too Early**: Red background with up arrow "‚ñ≤ LATER"
- **Too Late**: Blue background with down arrow "‚ñº EARLIER"  
- **Correct**: Green background "CORRECT!"

#### Colorblind Accessibility
```css
/* Alternative colors for colorblind users */
html.color-blind .bg-red-200 { background-color: #fde047; } /* Yellow */
html.color-blind .bg-blue-200 { background-color: #a5b4fc; } /* Indigo */
```

### Historical Context Hints
Each wrong guess reveals a new historical event from the same target year:

```
"Hint: [Historical event from target year]"
```

**Educational Benefits:**
- Learn multiple events from each year
- Understand historical context and connections
- Build knowledge even when guessing wrong
