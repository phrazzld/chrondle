### Anonymous Play

- **No account required:** Start playing immediately without signing up
- **Local progress saving:** Your game progress is automatically saved to your browser's local storage
- **24-hour persistence:** Anonymous sessions remain active for 24 hours
- **Cross-session continuity:** Close your browser and return later - your puzzle progress is preserved

### Authenticated Play

- **Sign in with email:** Use magic links for passwordless authentication
- **Google sign-in:** Quick authentication with your Google account
- **Cross-device sync:** Your progress syncs across all your devices
- **Permanent history:** All your past games are saved permanently
- **Automatic migration:** When you create an account, your anonymous progress automatically transfers

### Mobile Authentication

- **Optimized for mobile:** Authentication uses redirect flow on mobile devices for better compatibility
- **Email app friendly:** Magic link authentication works seamlessly when switching between browser and email apps

## Technical Architecture

### Daily Puzzle Scheduling

Chrondle implements sophisticated scheduling to ensure puzzles reset at midnight Central Time:

#### DST-Aware Cron System

- **Automatic DST Handling:** The system detects whether Central Time is in CST (UTC-6) or CDT (UTC-5)
- **Daily Recalculation:** UTC offset is computed daily to handle DST transitions seamlessly
- **Spring Forward/Fall Back:** Correctly handles the twice-yearly time changes without manual intervention
- **Global Consistency:** All players worldwide receive the same puzzle at Central Time midnight

#### Implementation Details

```typescript
// Dynamic UTC hour calculation for Central Time midnight
function getUTCHourForCentralMidnight(): number {
  const now = new Date();
  const chicagoTime = new Date(now.toLocaleString("en-US", {
    timeZone: "America/Chicago"
  }));
  const isDST = /* DST detection logic */;
  return isDST ? 5 : 6; // UTC 5 AM (CDT) or 6 AM (CST)
}
```

- **Convex Cron Jobs:** Backend scheduled tasks run at the calculated UTC hour
- **Timezone Library:** Uses standard IANA timezone database (America/Chicago)
- **Edge Case Handling:** Properly manages the ambiguous hour during "fall back"

### Notification System Architecture

- **Service Worker:** Background script handles push notifications
- **Permission Management:** Graceful handling of permission states
- **Persistence:** User preferences saved to both localStorage and Convex
- **Cross-Device Sync:** Authenticated users' settings sync across devices

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

Before deploying Chrondle, you'll need accounts for:

- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)** - For hosting the Next.js application
- **[Convex](https://convex.dev)** - For the backend database and real-time sync
- **[Clerk](https://clerk.com)** - For authentication (optional but recommended)

### Environment Setup

Chrondle requires several environment variables for production deployment. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure:

#### Required Variables

**Convex Configuration:**

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` - Your Convex deployment URL (e.g., `https://your-project.convex.cloud`)
- `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` - Generate from Convex Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Deploy Keys

**Clerk Authentication:**

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - From Clerk Dashboard â†’ API Keys
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - From Clerk Dashboard â†’ API Keys (keep secure!)
- `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Create webhook at Clerk Dashboard â†’ Webhooks
  - Endpoint URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/clerk`
  - Subscribe to events: `user.created`, `user.updated`

#### Optional Variables

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - For AI-powered historical context features
- Stripe keys - For future premium features

### Deploying to Vercel

1. **Fork or push this repository to GitHub**

2. **Set up Convex:**

   ```bash
   npx convex deploy --prod
   ```

   This will create a production deployment and provide your `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`.

3. **Import to Vercel:**

   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository

4. **Configure Environment Variables in Vercel:**

   - Go to Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add all required variables from `.env.example`:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
     - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
     - `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY`
     - `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (if using Clerk webhooks)

5. **Configure Build Settings:**

   - Vercel should auto-detect Next.js settings
   - The build command is already configured in `vercel.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "buildCommand": "npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build' --cmd-url-env-var-name NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL"
     }
     ```

6. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will build and deploy your application

### Post-Deployment

1. **Configure Clerk Webhook (if using authentication):**

   - In Clerk Dashboard, update the webhook endpoint to your production URL:
     `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks/clerk`

2. **Verify Deployment:**
   - Visit your deployed URL
   - Check that daily puzzles load correctly
   - Test user authentication (if configured)
   - Verify puzzle archive functionality
