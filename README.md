# Chrondle - The Daily History Game

**Guess the year of historical events in 6 tries or less!**

Chrondle is a Wordle-inspired game where players guess the year when significant historical events occurred. Each day features a new puzzle with events from the same target year, and all players worldwide get the same puzzle.

## üéØ How to Play

1. **Read the historical event** displayed at the top
2. **Enter a year** (including BC years like -776 for 776 BC)
3. **Get feedback** with directional hints and new historical events
4. **Refine your guesses** using the clues provided
5. **Win** by guessing the correct year in 6 attempts or less!

### Example Gameplay
```
Event: "The Boeing 747 makes its first flight"
Your guess: 1975 AD
Feedback: ‚ñº EARLIER
New hint: "The Internet precursor ARPANET is created"

Your guess: 1968 AD  
Feedback: ‚ñ≤ LATER
New hint: "The Stonewall riots occur in New York"

Your guess: 1969 AD
Result: üü© CORRECT!
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Players

2. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve it locally
3. All game logic is contained in the single HTML file

```bash
# Simple local server (optional)
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

## üîß Configuration

The game uses these configurable elements:

- **API Key**: Located in the `API_NINJAS_KEY` constant
- **Curated Years**: 50+ historically significant years in `CURATED_YEARS` array
- **Fallback Events**: Hardcoded 1969 events for when API fails
- **Max Guesses**: 6 attempts (configurable in `gameState.maxGuesses`)

## üåü Game Design Philosophy

Chrondle follows the **"Make it work, make it fast, make it pretty"** philosophy:

1. **Working software first** - Robust fallbacks ensure the game always works
2. **Performance** - Minimal dependencies, fast loading, efficient caching
3. **Polish** - Beautiful UI, smooth animations, delightful interactions

### Event Progression System
Events are sorted by recognizability to create a satisfying difficulty curve:
- **First hint**: Most obscure event (e.g., technical specifications)
- **Later hints**: Increasingly famous events (e.g., cultural milestones)
- **Final hints**: Universally known events (e.g., Moon landing, major wars)

## üõ† Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- **Fonts**: Inter + Playfair Display (Google Fonts)
- **API**: API Ninjas Historical Events
- **Storage**: LocalStorage for settings and progress

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Years
Edit the `CURATED_YEARS` array to include additional historically significant years:

```javascript
const CURATED_YEARS = [
    -776, -753, -221, -44,  // BC years
    1066, 1215, 1347, 1453, // Medieval
    1492, 1517, 1588, 1607, // Renaissance
    // ... add more years
];
```

### Modifying Event Scoring
The `scoreEventRecognizability()` function determines hint progression. Adjust the keyword lists to change difficulty:

```javascript
const highRecognitionTerms = [
    'moon', 'apollo', 'president', 'war', 'peace'
    // Add more recognizable terms
];
```
