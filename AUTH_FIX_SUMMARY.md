# Authentication Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed Automatically âœ…

1. **Fixed React infinite loop in UserCreationHandler.tsx**

   - Added useCallback and useMemo hooks to prevent unstable references
   - Fixed useEffect dependencies causing infinite re-renders
   - This stops the page from hanging

2. **Updated Convex auth.config.ts**
   - Now supports BOTH development and production Clerk domains
   - Will accept tokens from either environment
   - Deployed to your production Convex instance

## What You Need to Do Manually ðŸ“‹

### Option 1: Use Development Environment (Easiest - 2 minutes)

Since you already have development keys configured, just:

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Sign in with Google
3. Navigate to /archive - it should work now!

### Option 2: Switch to Production Keys (For Production - 5 minutes)

If you want to use production authentication:

1. **Copy production environment variables:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.production .env.local
   ```

2. **Restart the dev server:**

   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Update your Clerk Dashboard:**
   - Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com
   - Select your production instance
   - Add `http://localhost:3000` to allowed origins (for local testing)
   - Or use your production domain

## What Was the Problem?

1. **Domain Mismatch**: Convex was only accepting tokens from `healthy-doe-23.clerk.accounts.dev` but couldn't validate them properly
2. **Infinite Loop**: UserCreationHandler had unstable dependencies causing React to re-render infinitely
3. **Authentication Cascade Failure**: When auth failed, retry logic made it worse

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Sign in with Google OAuth
- [ ] Navigate to /archive page
- [ ] No console errors about "No auth provider found"
- [ ] No WebSocket reconnection loops
- [ ] Page loads without hanging

## If Issues Persist

1. Clear your browser cookies/cache for localhost
2. Check browser console for any new error messages
3. Ensure Convex deployment matches your environment:
   - Dev: `handsome-raccoon-955`
   - Prod: `fleet-goldfish-183` (current)

The main fixes are deployed and ready - you just need to test with your browser!
