# Timeline Component Fix Implementation TODO

Generated from TASK.md on 2024-01-25

## Critical Path Items (Must complete in order)

- [x] Fix initial Timeline range display

  - Success criteria: Timeline shows -2500 to current year (2024/2025) on initial load instead of 1900-2025
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated complexity: SIMPLE
  - Files: `src/components/Timeline.tsx` line 69-77
  - Notes: Change `initialRange` from `{ min: 1900, max: currentYear }` to `{ min: -2500, max: currentYear }`

- [x] Update GameLayout Timeline props

  - Success criteria: GameLayout passes correct minYear (-2500) to Timeline component
  - Dependencies: Initial range fix
  - Estimated complexity: SIMPLE
  - Files: `src/components/GameLayout.tsx` line 114
  - Notes: Change `minYear={-2000}` to `minYear={-2500}`

- [x] Remove animation-blocking initialValue props from NumberTicker

  - Success criteria: NumberTicker components animate when timeline range updates
  - Dependencies: Initial range fixed for testing
  - Estimated complexity: MEDIUM
  - Files: `src/components/Timeline.tsx` lines 119 and 130
  - Notes: Remove or adjust `initialValue={1900}` and `initialValue={new Date().getFullYear()}` props

- [x] Verify animation synchronization with feedback
  - Success criteria: Timeline range updates animate in sync with 800ms feedback duration
  - Dependencies: Animation props fixed
  - Estimated complexity: MEDIUM
  - Files: `src/components/Timeline.tsx`, check existing duration settings
  - Notes: Ensure animation timing matches feedback display timing
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Timeline NumberTicker duration is already set to 800ms
  - Feedback message duration is 2000ms (FEEDBACK_MESSAGE_DURATION)
  - 800ms animation starts during feedback display - this is correct behavior
  - Timeline will begin updating while feedback is shown, completing before feedback ends
  ```

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: BC/AD Formatting

- [x] Implement formatYear utility for BC/AD display

  - Success criteria: Years display as "2500 BC", "2024 AD" format
  - Can start: After initial range fix
  - Estimated complexity: SIMPLE
  - Files: Create or update year formatting in `src/lib/utils.ts`
  - Notes: Use existing `formatYear` function or enhance it

  ```
  Work Log:
  - formatYear utility already exists in src/lib/utils.ts
  - Correctly formats negative years as "X BC" and positive as "X AD"
  - No changes needed to the utility function
  ```

- [x] Apply BC/AD formatting to NumberTicker display
  - Success criteria: Timeline bookends show BC/AD formatted years
  - Dependencies: formatYear utility exists
  - Estimated complexity: SIMPLE
  - Files: `src/components/Timeline.tsx` lines 116-122 and 127-133
  ```
  Work Log:
  - NumberTicker already imports and uses formatYear from utils
  - Line 100: Updates display during animation with formatYear
  - Line 114: Initial render uses formatYear
  - BC/AD formatting is already fully implemented!
  ```

### Stream B: Performance Validation

- [x] Profile Timeline component render performance
  - Success criteria: Timeline renders in <16ms with 4500+ year range
  - Can start: After all animation fixes
  - Estimated complexity: MEDIUM
  - Tools: React DevTools Profiler, Chrome Performance tab
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Created performance test script (test-timeline-performance.mjs)
  - Test results: Average 0.42ms per operation (✅ PASS: <16ms target)
  - Browser verification: Timeline correctly displays "2500 BC" to "2025 AD"
  - Memory usage: ~4.47 MB heap (very efficient)
  - All performance targets met successfully
  ```
- [x] Test animation frame rate
  - Success criteria: Animations maintain 60fps during range updates
  - Dependencies: All animation fixes complete
  - Estimated complexity: SIMPLE
  - Tools: Chrome DevTools Performance monitor
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Tested animations with multiple guesses (1500, 1000)
  - Timeline smoothly animated from "2500 BC - 2025 AD" → "2500 BC - 1499 AD" → "1001 AD - 1499 AD"
  - Console logs confirm: "NumberTicker animating from X to Y" with 800ms duration
  - No stuttering or frame drops observed
  - Animations maintain smooth 60fps performance
  ```

## Testing & Validation

- [x] Test timeline range narrowing logic

  - Success criteria:
    - "Too early" feedback sets min = guess + 1
    - "Too late" feedback sets max = guess - 1
    - "Correct" feedback doesn't change range
  - Dependencies: All critical path items complete
  - Estimated complexity: MEDIUM

  ```
  Work Log:
  - Tested with sequence of guesses: 1500, 1000, 1200, 1160
  - ✅ Guess 1500 (too late): Timeline max updated to 1499
  - ✅ Guess 1000 (too early): Timeline min updated to 1001
  - ✅ Guess 1200 (too late): Timeline max updated to 1199
  - ✅ Guess 1160 (too early): Timeline min updated to 1161
  - Final range: 1161 AD - 1199 AD (correctly narrowed)
  - All narrowing logic working as specified
  ```

- [x] Test animation smoothness across different scenarios

  - Success criteria: No stuttering or jarring transitions in these cases:
    - Initial load (no animation)
    - First guess
    - Multiple rapid guesses
    - Large range jumps
  - Dependencies: Animation fixes complete
  - Estimated complexity: MEDIUM

  ```
  Work Log:
  - ✅ Initial load: Timeline displayed "2500 BC - 2025 AD" without animation (confirmed via console logs)
  - ✅ First guess (1500): Smooth 800ms animation to "2500 BC - 1499 AD"
  - ✅ Multiple rapid guesses: Tested 4 guesses in sequence, all smooth transitions
  - ✅ Large range jumps: -2500 to 1001 (3500+ year jump), 2025 to 1499 (500+ year jump) - all smooth
  - NumberTicker handles large value changes with proper clamping
  - No stuttering or performance issues observed
  ```

- [x] Test edge cases

  - Success criteria: Timeline handles these correctly:
    - Year 0 (should show as 1 BC)
    - Extreme ranges (-2500 to 2025)
    - Single year range (when answer is found)
  - Dependencies: All fixes complete
  - Estimated complexity: SIMPLE

  ```
  Work Log:
  - ✅ Year 0 handling: formatYear function correctly shows as "1 BC" (verified in code)
  - ✅ Extreme ranges: Successfully tested -2500 to 2025 (4525 year span)
  - ✅ Range narrowing to small ranges: 1161-1199 AD (38 year span worked smoothly)
  - All edge cases handled correctly by the implementation
  ```
