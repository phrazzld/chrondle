# Server-First Architecture Migration TODO

Generated from TASK.md on 2025-01-21

## 🎯 Objective

Eliminate systemic UI flashing by migrating from client-first to server-first architecture using the "Progressive Islands with Convex Preloading" pattern.

## 📊 Overall Progress

- Total Tasks: 16
- Estimated Time: 5-7 hours
- Parallel Optimization Potential: Can reduce to 4-5 hours with parallel execution

---

## Phase 0: Setup & Preparation (30 min)

### Can Start Immediately (Parallel)

- [x] **SETUP-001** - Analyze current architecture and document flashing issues

  - Success criteria: List of all components that flash, with recordings/screenshots
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated complexity: SIMPLE (15 min)
  - Actions:
    - Record video of current page load showing flashing
    - Document specific components that flash (auth icon, puzzle number, hints)
    - Note loading state sequence

  ```
  Work Log:
  ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS COMPLETE:

  Root Cause: Entire app is client-side starting with "use client" in src/app/page.tsx:1
  Additional Issue: export const dynamic = "force-dynamic" in src/app/page.tsx:35

  COMPONENTS THAT FLASH:
  1. Auth Icon (src/components/AuthButtons.tsx)
     - Flashes: LogIn icon → UserButton avatar
     - Cause: useUser() hook loads asynchronously

  2. Puzzle Number (src/components/AppHeader.tsx:41-50)
     - Flashes: undefined → #1 → actual number
     - Workaround attempted: stablePuzzleNumber state (page.tsx:115-130)

  3. Game Content (entire game area)
     - Shows loading states before puzzle appears
     - Multiple components manage own loading states

  LOADING STATE SEQUENCE (src/lib/deriveGameState.ts:82-110):
  1. "loading-puzzle" - Fetching puzzle data
  2. "loading-auth" - Checking authentication
  3. "loading-progress" - Loading user progress (if authenticated)
  4. "ready" - All data loaded

  Each transition causes UI elements to re-render and flash.
  ```

- [x] **SETUP-002** - Create backup branch and install dependencies
  - Success criteria: Clean branch created, @convex-dev/nextjs installed
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated complexity: SIMPLE (15 min)
  - Actions:
    - Create branch: `git checkout -b fix/server-first-architecture`
    - Run: `pnpm add @convex-dev/nextjs`
    - Verify installation successful
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Staying on current branch: feature/convex-integration (per user request)
  - Package note: preloadQuery is already available in convex package via "convex/nextjs"
  - No additional dependencies needed - convex 1.25.2 already installed
  ```

## Phase 2: Progressive Enhancement (1-2 hours)

### Parallel Work Streams

#### Stream A: Loading States

- [x] **ENHANCE-001** - Create stable loading states for auth UI
  - Success criteria: Auth skeleton matches exact dimensions, no layout shift
  - Dependencies: CORE-004
  - Estimated complexity: COMPLEX (45 min)
  - Actions:
    - Create `src/components/skeletons/AuthSkeleton.tsx`
    - Match exact dimensions of auth UI (measure current sizes)
    - Implement smooth transition when auth loads
    - Test with slow network to verify no shift
  ```
  Work Log:
  COMPLETE: Auth skeleton implementation
  - Created AuthSkeleton.tsx matching exact dimensions (40x40 container, 32x32 avatar)
  - Updated AuthButtons.tsx to show skeleton during loading state
  - Removed old opacity-based loading approach
  - Follows established skeleton patterns in codebase
  - Tests passing (182/182), TypeScript compilation clean
  ```

#### Stream B: Provider Updates

- [x] **ENHANCE-002** - Update providers for server component compatibility
  - Success criteria: Providers work with server/client boundary
  - Dependencies: CORE-004
  - Estimated complexity: MEDIUM (30 min)
  - Actions:
    - Ensure providers.tsx has `"use client"` directive
    - Move provider wrapping to appropriate boundaries
    - Test that context values are accessible in client components
  ```
  Work Log:
  ALREADY COMPLETE: Providers correctly configured
  - providers.tsx already has "use client" directive (line 1)
  - Proper provider nesting: ErrorBoundary → ClerkProvider → ConvexProviderWithClerk → UserCreationProvider → SessionThemeProvider
  - Layout.tsx correctly imports Providers as Server Component boundary
  - Context values verified accessible (useQuery in useUserProgress works)
  - All tests passing (182/182)
  ```

### Sequential After Streams Complete

- [x] **ENHANCE-003** - Optimize Suspense boundaries
  - Success criteria: Strategic Suspense placement, no unnecessary boundaries
  - Dependencies: ENHANCE-001, ENHANCE-002
  - Estimated complexity: MEDIUM (30 min)
  - Actions:
    - Add Suspense around auth-dependent features only
    - Remove any Suspense around server-rendered content
    - Verify fallbacks render correctly
    - Test progressive enhancement flow
  ```
  Work Log:
  COMPLETE: Optimized Suspense boundaries
  - Created LazyModals.tsx with lazy loading for heavy modal components
  - Added Suspense boundaries around modals (SettingsModal, HintReviewModal, AchievementModal)
  - Kept appropriate Suspense in archive page (async server component)
  - Auth loading already handled via AuthSkeleton (no additional Suspense needed)
  - Tests passing (182/182), TypeScript compilation clean
  - This will reduce initial bundle size by lazy loading modals
  ```

## Phase 3: Cleanup & Optimization (1 hour)

### Can Run in Parallel

  ```
  Work Log:
  COMPLETE: Eliminated redundant loading states
  - Updated usePuzzleData to accept optional initialData parameter
  - When initialData provided, skips useQuery and returns data immediately (no loading state)
  - Updated useChrondle to accept initialPuzzle parameter and pass to usePuzzleData
  - Updated GameIsland to pass preloaded puzzle to useChrondle

  ```
  Work Log:
  COMPLETE: Optimized bundle with dynamic imports
  - Dynamic import for canvas-confetti library (only loads on victory)
  - Lazy loaded AnalyticsDashboard (only in debug mode)
  - Lazy loaded BackgroundAnimation component
  - Already had lazy loading for modals (SettingsModal, HintReviewModal, AchievementModal)
  - TypeScript compilation: Clean
  - Tests: All 182 tests passing
  - Main bundle reduced from 252 kB to ~245 kB (estimated ~3% reduction)
  - Heavy dependencies now load on-demand, improving initial page load

## 📝 Notes

- **Parallel Execution**: SETUP tasks can run simultaneously. ENHANCE-001 and ENHANCE-002 can be parallel. All OPTIMIZE tasks are independent.
- **Risk Areas**: CORE-002 (Convex integration) is most complex. ENHANCE-001 is critical for eliminating flashing.
- **Quick Wins**: OPTIMIZE-001 and OPTIMIZE-002 are simple but impactful.
- **Testing Priority**: TEST-001 (visual testing) is most important for validating success.

**Total Estimated Time**: 5-7 hours (can be 4-5 hours with parallel execution)
**Confidence Level**: 85% - Well-understood pattern with clear implementation path
