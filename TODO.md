---

## Original Context

- **Original State**: 1,422 lines of god objects across puzzles.ts (690L) and users.ts (732L)
- **Problem**: 7 distinct responsibilities in puzzles.ts, 5 in users.ts, 80 lines of duplicated code
- **Approach**: Extract focused modules with clear boundaries, eliminate duplication
- **Key Pattern**: Each module owns ONE responsibility, hides implementation complexity
- **Validation**: `pnpm type-check`, all imports auto-update via Convex codegen

## Phase 1: Extract Puzzle Generation Module (Eliminate Duplication)

**Goal**: DRY violation elimination first - extract shared generation logic

- [x] **Create `convex/puzzles/generation.ts` with shared helper**

  ```
  Files: convex/puzzles/generation.ts (NEW), convex/puzzles.ts:40-80, 178-212
  Approach: Extract `selectYearForPuzzle(ctx)` helper from duplicated code
  Module: Single responsibility - puzzle year selection algorithm
  Interface: async function selectYearForPuzzle(ctx: QueryCtx): Promise<{ year, events }>
  Success: Both generateDailyPuzzle and ensureTodaysPuzzle call helper, duplicate code removed
  Test: Existing puzzles.ts tests still pass, generation logic unchanged
  Time: 45min
  ```

  **Implementation Details**:

  - Extract lines 40-80 from puzzles.ts (unused event query + year selection)
  - Helper function returns `{ year: number, events: Event[], availableEvents: number }`
  - Import helper in puzzles.ts and replace both duplicated blocks
  - Preserve all logic: yearCounts Map, filtering 6+ events, random selection
  - NO behavior changes - pure refactor

- [x] **Update `generateDailyPuzzle` to use helper**

  ```
  Files: convex/puzzles.ts:15-140
  Approach: Replace lines 40-80 with call to selectYearForPuzzle()
  Success: Function compiles, generates puzzles correctly
  Test: Run generation manually with `convex run puzzles:generateDailyPuzzle`
  Time: 15min
  ```

- [x] **Update `ensureTodaysPuzzle` to use helper**
  ```
  Files: convex/puzzles.ts:155-239
  Approach: Replace lines 178-212 with call to selectYearForPuzzle()
  Success: Function compiles, ensures puzzle correctly
  Test: Frontend puzzle loading still works
  Time: 15min
  ```

## Phase 2: Split puzzles.ts God Object (7 ‚Üí 7 Focused Modules)

  Success: All imports resolved, webhook still creates users
  Test: Full auth flow works, `pnpm type-check` passes
  Time: 15min
  ```

## Phase 4: Update Frontend Imports

**Goal**: All frontend code uses new module paths

**STATUS**: ‚úÖ **PHASE COMPLETE - NO CHANGES NEEDED**

**Implementation Notes**:

- Barrel file pattern maintains backward compatibility
- `convex/puzzles.ts` re-exports from focused modules ‚Üí `api.puzzles.*` still works
- `convex/users.ts` re-exports from focused modules ‚Üí `api.users.*` still works
- TypeScript compilation clean: `pnpm type-check` ‚úÖ
- All 500 tests passing: `pnpm test:ci` ‚úÖ
- Frontend imports require NO updates (Deep Module principle - simple interface hiding complex implementation)

**Verification**:

```bash
# Found 13 files using api imports - all still work correctly
grep -r "from.*convex.*generated.*api" src/
# Examples still working:
# - api.puzzles.getDailyPuzzle (via puzzles.ts ‚Üí puzzles/queries.ts)
# - api.users.getCurrentUser (via users.ts ‚Üí users/queries.ts)
# - api.users.mergeAnonymousStreak (via users.ts ‚Üí migration/anonymous.ts)
```

- [x] **Update all `api.puzzles.*` imports** - NOT NEEDED (barrel file pattern)
- [x] **Update all `api.users.*` imports** - NOT NEEDED (barrel file pattern)

## Phase 5: Test Coverage & Validation

**Goal**: Verify no regressions, all functionality preserved

- [x] **Run full test suite**

  ```
  Command: pnpm test:ci
  Success: ‚úÖ All 500 tests pass (27 test files)

  Time: 3.95s
  ```

  **Test Results**:

  - Core game logic: 22 tests ‚úÖ
  - Secure storage: 21 tests ‚úÖ
  - React hooks: 39 tests ‚úÖ
  - Archive puzzle streaks: 15 tests ‚úÖ
  - Anonymous streak merge: 13 tests ‚úÖ
  - Integration tests: 18 tests ‚úÖ

- [x] **Run type checking**

  ```
  Command: pnpm type-check
  Success: ‚úÖ Zero TypeScript errors
  Time: ~5s
  ```

  **Verification**: Barrel file re-exports maintain full type safety across all modules

- [ ] **Manual smoke tests** - REQUIRES USER TESTING

  ```
  Tests (user must verify in browser):
  - [ ] Daily puzzle loads and is playable (uses api.puzzles.getDailyPuzzle ‚Üí puzzles/queries.ts)
  - [ ] Archive page displays completed puzzles (uses api.puzzles.getUserCompletedPuzzles ‚Üí plays/queries.ts)
  - [ ] Guess submission works and updates stats (uses api.puzzles.submitGuess ‚Üí puzzles/mutations.ts)
  - [ ] Streaks update correctly for daily puzzles (uses updateUserStreak in streaks/mutations.ts)
  - [ ] Anonymous play works (localStorage + local session hooks)
  - [ ] Sign-in merges anonymous data (uses api.users.mergeAnonymousStreak ‚Üí migration/anonymous.ts)
  - [ ] Webhook creates users (uses api.users.createUserFromWebhook ‚Üí users/mutations.ts)
  - [ ] Historical context generates for new puzzles (uses updateHistoricalContext ‚Üí puzzles/context.ts)

  Success: All manual tests pass
  Time: 30min

  Note: Automated tests verify 500 unit/integration test cases.
  Manual testing confirms end-to-end user flows work in production environment.
  ```

  **Module Coverage Map**:

  ```
  puzzles/queries.ts     ‚Üí Daily puzzle loading
  puzzles/mutations.ts   ‚Üí Guess submission
  puzzles/generation.ts  ‚Üí Cron job puzzle creation
  puzzles/context.ts     ‚Üí AI historical context
  plays/queries.ts       ‚Üí User play history
  plays/statistics.ts    ‚Üí Play aggregation

  users/statistics.ts    ‚Üí User stats updates
  migration/anonymous.ts ‚Üí Anonymous data merge
  streaks/mutations.ts   ‚Üí Streak tracking
  system/scheduling.ts   ‚Üí Countdown timer
  ```

## Design Iteration Checkpoints

**After Phase 2 (puzzles.ts split)**:

- Review: Are module boundaries clear? Any coupling detected?
- Measure: Lines per module (target ~100-150), function count (target 3-6 per module)
- Consider: Any shared patterns that should be extracted to lib/?

**After Phase 3 (users.ts split)**:

- Review: Is migration logic properly isolated? Security concerns addressed?
- Measure: Test coverage for new modules
- Consider: Documentation needs for complex migration flows?

**After Phase 5 (completion)**:

- [x] Document: New module structure in convex/README.md ‚úÖ
- [x] Metrics: Total lines reduced? God objects eliminated? Duplication removed? ‚úÖ
  - God objects: 1,422L ‚Üí 60L barrel files (96% reduction)
  - Focused modules: 11 modules created (average 162 lines)
  - Test coverage: 500/500 tests passing
  - Zero breaking changes
- [ ] Next: Address other BACKLOG items (security fixes, UX improvements)

## Automation Opportunities

**Identified Patterns**:

- Extract mutation/query ‚Üí Create new file ‚Üí Update imports (repeatable)
- Could create script: `scripts/split-convex-module.ts <source> <target> <functions...>`
- Would automate: File creation, export extraction, import updates

**Not Implementing Now**: Focus on manual refactor first, automate if pattern repeats

## Success Criteria

- [x] Zero TypeScript errors (`pnpm type-check`) ‚úÖ
- [x] All tests pass (`pnpm test`) ‚úÖ 500/500 tests passing
- [ ] No functional regressions (manual smoke tests pass) ‚è≥ Pending user browser testing
- [x] 1,422 lines ‚Üí focused modules ‚úÖ Achieved: 1,422L ‚Üí 60L barrel files + 1,786L focused modules
- [x] puzzles.ts (690L) ‚Üí 7 modules ‚úÖ Achieved: 4 puzzles/ + 2 plays/ + 1 system/ = 7 modules
- [x] users.ts (732L) ‚Üí 5 modules ‚úÖ Achieved: 3 users/ + 1 migration/ + 1 streaks/ = 5 modules
- [x] Code organization improved ‚úÖ 10/12 modules under 150 lines (83% success rate)
- [x] Clear module boundaries (each module has single responsibility) ‚úÖ
- [x] Convex API auto-generates correct paths ‚úÖ Barrel files maintain backward compatibility

## Estimated Total Time

- Phase 1 (Duplication): 1h 15min
- Phase 2 (puzzles.ts split): 5h 15min
- Phase 3 (users.ts split): 5h
- Phase 4 (Frontend imports): 1h 45min
- Phase 5 (Testing): 45min
- **Total: ~14 hours** (vs. original estimate 12h, more accurate with detailed breakdown)

## Notes

- **Convex Auto-Generation**: API paths auto-update, TypeScript catches all import errors
- **No Breaking Changes**: All functions preserve exact same behavior
- **Test Safety Net**: Existing tests validate no regressions
- **Incremental Migration**: Can merge after each phase if needed
- **Module Value**: Each new module has Value = Functionality - Interface Complexity > 0
  - Example: `generation.ts` hides 80 lines of complex logic behind simple `selectYearForPuzzle()` interface
