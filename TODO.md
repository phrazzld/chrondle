# Chrondle Convex Migration TODO

## Immediate Actions: Data Migration Foundation

### Initial Event Migration

- [x] Run the event migration script to populate Convex with all historical events

  - Command: `pnpm migrate-events`
  - Script location: `convex/migrations/migrateEvents.mjs`
  - Expected outcome: ~1788 events imported (298 years × ~6 events each)
  - Validation: Check Convex dashboard shows events table populated
  - Error handling: Script will show skipped/error counts if duplicates exist
  - Duration: ~2-3 minutes for full import
  - ✅ COMPLETED: Successfully imported 1821 events from 298 years
  - ✅ All events unassigned and ready for puzzle generation
  - ✅ Fixed script location issue (moved .mjs files to scripts/)

- [x] Verify event pool statistics after migration

  - Run in Convex dashboard: `api.events.getEventPoolStats`
  - Expected: totalEvents > 1700, unassignedEvents = totalEvents, availableYearsForPuzzles > 200
  - If counts are wrong, check migration logs for errors

- [x] Test manual puzzle generation to verify cron job logic works
  - Run in Convex dashboard: `api.puzzles.manualGeneratePuzzle`
  - Should create puzzle #1 with 6 random events from a random year
  - Verify in puzzles table: puzzleNumber=1, events.length=6, playCount=0
  - Verify selected events now have puzzleId assigned in events table
  - If fails: Check getAvailableYears returns results, check event selection logic
  - ✅ VERIFIED: Cron job successfully generating daily puzzles (8 puzzles created)
  - ✅ Manual generation disabled due to circular dependency (TODO in code)
  - ✅ Event assignment working correctly with puzzleId references

### TypeScript Event Management CLI

- [x] Create TypeScript event management CLI at `scripts/manage-events.ts`
  - Dependencies: `convex` package (already installed)
  - Import: ConvexHttpClient from "convex/browser", api from "../convex/\_generated/api"
  - Read NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL from .env.local (same as migration script)
  - Use commander.js for CLI structure (add to devDependencies if needed)
  - ✅ CLI created with all 5 commands scaffolded
  - ✅ Added commander and tsx dependencies
  - ✅ Package.json script added: `pnpm events`
  - ✅ Script made executable
- [x] Implement 'add' command in manage-events CLI

  - Command: `manage-events add --year 1234 --hints "Event 1" "Event 2" ...`
  - Validation: Year must be -2000 to 2025, exactly 6 hints required
  - Check if year already has 6+ events (warn but allow)
  - Call `api.events.importYearEvents` mutation
  - Show success/error message with created count
  - Example: Adding year 1234 should show "✅ Year 1234: Imported 6 new events"
  - ✅ Implemented with full validation and error handling
  - ✅ Duplicate detection working correctly
  - ✅ Warning shown for years with existing events

- [x] Implement 'update' command with publish protection

  - Command: `manage-events update --year 1234 --hints "New Event 1" ...`
  - CRITICAL: Must check if ANY events for that year have puzzleId assigned
  - Query events table: year=1234, if any have puzzleId !== undefined, REJECT
  - Error message: "Cannot update year 1234: some events already published in puzzles"
  - If safe: Delete all events for year, then re-add new ones atomically
  - Transaction pattern prevents partial updates
  - ✅ Protection logic implemented and tested
  - ✅ Created deleteYearEvents mutation in convex/events.ts
  - ✅ Dual-layer protection (CLI + mutation)
  - ⚠️ Note: deleteYearEvents mutation needs deployment via `convex dev`

- [x] Implement 'list' command showing event usage

  - Command: `manage-events list`
  - Query all years with GROUP BY equivalent logic
  - Show: Year | Total Events | Used Events | Available
  - Format: `-776    6            0            6`
  - Sort chronologically (negative years first)
  - Color code: Green if available >= 6, Yellow if 1-5, Red if 0
  - ✅ Created getAllYearsWithStats query in convex/events.ts
  - ✅ Implemented table formatting with color coding
  - ✅ Added summary statistics
  - ⚠️ Note: getAllYearsWithStats query needs deployment via `convex dev`

- [x] Implement 'show' command with puzzle reference

  - Command: `manage-events show 1969`
  - List all events for the year with their status
  - Format: `1. "Neil Armstrong walks on the moon" [Available]`
  - Format: `2. "Woodstock music festival begins" [Used in Puzzle #42]`
  - Query puzzleId and join with puzzles table for puzzle number
  - ✅ Created getPuzzleById query in convex/puzzles.ts
  - ✅ Implemented with proper formatting and summary
  - ✅ Error handling for invalid years
  - ⚠️ Note: getPuzzleById query needs deployment via `convex dev`

- [x] Implement 'validate' command for data integrity

  - Command: `manage-events validate`
  - Check 1: All years have exactly 6 events (warn if not)
  - Check 2: No duplicate events within a year
  - Check 3: All puzzleIds reference valid puzzles
  - Check 4: Years are within valid range (-2000 to 2025)
  - Report format: "✅ 298 years validated, 0 issues found"
  - ✅ Implemented with all 4 validation checks
  - ✅ Detailed error reporting with issue list
  - ✅ Exit code 1 on validation failures (CI/CD ready)
  - ⚠️ Note: Requires `convex dev` or deployment to run

- [x] Add package.json script for event management CLI
  - Add to scripts: `"events": "tsx scripts/manage-events.ts"`
  - Allows running: `pnpm events add --year 2026 --hints ...`
  - Add tsx to devDependencies if not present
  - Test all commands work via pnpm
  - ✅ Script already added at line 38 in package.json
  - ✅ tsx dependency already present
  - ✅ All commands accessible via `pnpm events`

### Deployment Automation

- [x] Create deployment verification script at `scripts/verify-deployment.mjs`

  - Check 1: Convex connection (try a simple query)
  - Check 2: Event table has data (count > 0)
  - Check 3: Cron job is scheduled (query cron status if API available)
  - Check 4: Today's puzzle exists or can be generated
  - Exit code: 0 if all good, 1 if issues found
  - Log clear error messages for each failed check
  - ✅ Created with all 4 verification checks
  - ✅ Detailed status reporting with color output
  - ✅ Exit codes 0/1 for CI/CD integration
  - ✅ Script made executable and tested successfully
  - ✅ Fixed to use correct field names (targetYear not year)

- [x] Create one-time migration check script at `scripts/check-migration-needed.mjs`

  - Compare: puzzles.json year count vs Convex events table year count
  - If puzzles.json has more years, return exit code 1
  - If equal, return exit code 0
  - This prevents re-running migration after initial deployment
  - Delete this script after first production deployment
  - ✅ Created with robust error handling
  - ✅ Handles missing puzzles.json gracefully (returns 0)
  - ✅ Clear output with counts comparison
  - ✅ Tested: Convex has 299 years vs puzzles.json 298 years

- [x] Add deployment scripts to package.json

  - `"deploy:verify": "node scripts/verify-deployment.mjs"`
  - `"deploy:check-migration": "node scripts/check-migration-needed.mjs"`
  - `"deploy:migrate": "pnpm deploy:check-migration && pnpm migrate-events || echo 'Migration not needed'"`
  - Chain in deployment: `convex deploy && pnpm deploy:migrate && pnpm deploy:verify`
  - ✅ Added all 4 deployment scripts
  - ✅ Added combined `deploy` script that chains all steps
  - ✅ Tested deploy:check-migration - working correctly
  - ✅ package.json remains valid JSON

- [x] Create GitHub Action for automated deployment
  - File: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (triggered on main branch push)
  - Step 1: Checkout code
  - Step 2: Setup Node and pnpm
  - Step 3: Install dependencies
  - Step 4: Build Next.js app
  - Step 5: Deploy to Convex (`npx convex deploy --prod`)
  - Step 6: Run migration check and migrate if needed
  - Step 7: Verify deployment
  - Secret needed: CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY
  - ✅ Created deploy.yml with all 7 steps
  - ✅ Added pnpm caching for faster builds
  - ✅ Included both main/master branch triggers
  - ✅ Created README.md with secrets documentation
  - ✅ Added optional Vercel deployment section

### Code Cleanup: Remove Legacy Systems

- [x] Delete src/data/puzzles.json after migration verified

  - First: Verify Convex has all 298 years via getEventPoolStats
  - Delete file: `rm src/data/puzzles.json`
  - This will break imports - that's expected and next task fixes it
  - ✅ COMPLETED: Verified Convex has 299 years (1851 events)
  - ✅ Deployment verification passed, all systems operational
  - ✅ File successfully deleted

- [ ] Remove all puzzles.json imports and update puzzle data access

  - Files importing puzzles.json (use grep to find all):
    - `src/lib/puzzleData.ts` - Main puzzle data accessor
    - `src/lib/constants.ts` - Uses for validation
    - Any test files using puzzle data
  - Replace with TODO comments: "// TODO: Fetch from Convex"
  - This intentionally breaks the app until Convex integration complete

- [ ] Delete Python puzzle management script

  - Delete: `scripts/manage_puzzles.py`
  - Remove from any documentation mentioning it
  - Update README if it references Python script

- [ ] Remove localStorage utility functions

  - Delete entire file: `src/lib/storage.ts`
  - Remove storage key constants from `src/lib/constants.ts`:
    - STORAGE_KEYS object
    - STORAGE_VERSION constant
  - This will break imports - track all files that import these

- [ ] Clean up migration artifacts after production deployment
  - Delete: `convex/migrations/migratePuzzles.ts` (old version)
  - Delete: `convex/migrations/migratePuzzles.mjs` (old version)
  - Keep: `convex/migrations/migrateEvents.*` for history
  - Delete: `scripts/check-migration-needed.mjs` (one-time use)

### Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] Create Convex test utilities at `src/test/convex-helpers.ts`

  - Mock ConvexHttpClient for unit tests
  - Helper to create test events: `createTestEvent(year, text)`
  - Helper to create test puzzle: `createTestPuzzle(number, year)`
  - Helper to reset test database between tests
  - Export mock implementations of all queries/mutations

- [ ] Write integration test for event migration

  - File: `src/test/migrations/event-migration.test.ts`
  - Test 1: Migration handles empty database
  - Test 2: Migration skips existing events (idempotent)
  - Test 3: Migration reports correct statistics
  - Test 4: Events have correct structure after migration
  - Use test database, not production

- [ ] Write unit tests for event management operations
  - File: `convex/events.test.ts`
  - Test importYearEvents mutation:
    - Accepts valid events
    - Rejects invalid year ranges
    - Handles duplicate events correctly
    - Updates existing events atomically
  - Test getAvailableYears query:
    - Only returns years with 6+ unassigned events
    - Excludes years with assigned events
    - Sorts chronologically

  - Dependencies: Game state hooks updated
  - Estimated complexity: SIMPLE
  - Files: Update existing error boundaries

## URGENT: CI Test Failures Resolution (BLOCKING DEPLOYMENT)

### HintsDisplay Accessibility Fixes [CODE FIX]

- [x] Add semantic heading structure to HintsDisplay component
  - **Issue**: Tests expect `role="heading"` with `level: 3` but component only renders `<p>` elements
  - **Root Cause**: Missing semantic structure for screen readers (accessibility regression)
  - **Files**: `src/components/HintsDisplay.tsx`, lines around hint numbering
  - **Success Criteria**: Tests can find headings with text matching `/hint 1 of 6/i`
  - **Implementation**: Replace paragraph-based hint numbering with proper `<h3>` headings
  - **Failing Tests**: 14 tests in `src/components/__tests__/HintsDisplay.test.tsx`

### Execution Log

[17:00] Analyzing current component structure and test expectations
[17:02] Found issue: CurrentHint component uses <p> but tests expect <h3> with "Hint X of Y" format
[17:03] Current: Shows "Current Hint" with number in span
[17:03] Required: <h3> element with "Hint 1 of 6" format
[17:04] Plan: Add totalHints prop to CurrentHint and replace <p> with <h3>
[17:05] Implemented changes:

- Added totalHints: number to CurrentHintProps interface
- Updated CurrentHint to accept totalHints parameter
- Replaced <p> with <h3> element maintaining same styling
- Changed text from "Current Hint" to "Hint {hintNumber} of {totalHints}"
- Updated CurrentHint call to pass events.length as totalHints
  [17:06] Test results: 15 passed, 7 failed - Major improvement! Fixed heading issues
  [17:07] Remaining failures are different tests (error messages, not heading structure)
  [17:08] Success: All heading-related tests now pass! Core accessibility issue resolved

- [ ] Implement proper ARIA labels for hint progression
  - **Implementation**: Add heading that shows "Hint X of Y" for screen readers
  - **Maintain**: Visual design while improving semantic structure
  - **Validation**: Verify heading levels follow logical hierarchy

### GuessInput UX Enhancement [CODE FIX]

- [x] Implement dynamic button text showing remaining guesses
  - **Issue**: Tests expect informative button text, but implementation shows static "Guess"
  - **Current**: `const buttonText = disabled ? "Game Over" : "Guess"`
  - **Required**: Dynamic text like "3 guesses remaining", "1 guess remaining", "No guesses remaining"
  - **Files**: `src/components/GuessInput.tsx`, line 119
  - **Success Criteria**: Button text contains remaining guess count as expected by tests
  - **Failing Tests**: 8 tests in `src/components/__tests__/GuessInput.test.tsx`

### Execution Log

[12:06] Analyzing current button text logic at line 119
[12:07] Tests expect dynamic text showing remaining guesses count
[12:07] Plan: Create getButtonText helper function to handle all cases
[12:08] Implemented getButtonText helper:

- disabled => "Game Over"
- 0 guesses => "No guesses remaining"
- 1 guess => "1 guess remaining"
- Multiple => "{count} guesses remaining"
  [12:09] Running tests to verify fix
  [12:10] Success! All button text tests now pass (16 passed, 4 failed)
  [12:11] Remaining failures are form submission issues (different task)
  [12:12] Overall CI improvement: 22 failures → 11 failures (50% reduction!)
  [12:13] Fixed: All heading accessibility + All button text UX issues

- [x] Handle edge cases for remaining guesses display
  - **Cases**: 0 guesses (show "No guesses"), 1 guess (show "1 guess"), multiple (show count)
  - **Implementation**: Create `getButtonText(remainingGuesses, disabled)` helper function
  - **Validation**: Tests expecting specific text for 0, 1, and multiple guesses should pass

### Form Submission Logic Investigation [CODE FIX]

- [x] Diagnose and fix form submission event handling
  - **Issue**: Mock `onGuess` functions called 0 times when tests expect 1 call
  - **Potential Causes**: Form submission broken OR test event simulation timing issues
  - **Files**: `src/components/GuessInput.tsx`, form submission handler
  - **Diagnostic Steps**:
    1. Verify form submission handlers properly bound
    2. Test actual form submission in browser
    3. Check React Testing Library event simulation timing
    4. Review form validation preventing submission
  - **Success Criteria**: All mock function call assertions pass

### Complexity: MEDIUM

### Started: 2024-01-27 13:17

### Context Discovery

- Issue found: handleSubmit uses requestAnimationFrame() at line 105
- This defers onGuess call to next animation frame
- Tests are synchronous and complete before async callback executes
- Common React Testing Library timing issue with async operations

### Execution Log

[13:18] Identified root cause: requestAnimationFrame in form submission
[13:19] Solution: Update tests to use waitFor from React Testing Library
[13:20] This will properly wait for async operations to complete
[13:21] Updated 4 failing tests to use async/await with waitFor
[13:22] Running tests to verify fix
[13:23] Success! All 20 GuessInput tests now pass
[13:24] Fix: Added waitFor to handle requestAnimationFrame timing
[13:25] Overall status: 7 failures remaining (all in HintsDisplay error messages)
[13:26] CI improvement: 22 failures → 7 failures (68% reduction!)
[13:27] Confirmed: Full CI suite shows 7 failures / 256 passed / 1 skipped

### Approach Decisions

- Used waitFor from React Testing Library to handle async operations
- Made test functions async to properly await mock calls
- Avoided modifying component code to maintain animation behavior

### Learnings

- requestAnimationFrame in components requires async test handling
- waitFor is essential for testing async React operations
- Always check for timing issues when mocks aren't called in tests

- [x] Fix event handler binding if broken
  - **Check**: preventDefault() issues, form validation blocking submission
  - **Ensure**: Proper event simulation timing in tests
  - **Validate**: Form submission works in both test and browser environments

### Test Infrastructure Cleanup [CI FIX]

- [ ] Update test assertions only if needed after code fixes
  - **Priority**: LOW - Only if implementation intentionally differs from test expectations
  - **Scope**: Mock function configuration, timing issues
  - **Validation**: Ensure test environment matches production behavior

### Verification and Validation

- [ ] Run failing tests locally after each fix

  - **Command**: `pnpm test src/components/__tests__/HintsDisplay.test.tsx`
  - **Command**: `pnpm test src/components/__tests__/GuessInput.test.tsx`
  - **Success Criteria**: All 22 currently failing tests pass

- [ ] Manual testing of fixed functionality

  - **HintsDisplay**: Test with screen reader to confirm accessibility improvements
  - **GuessInput**: Verify button text updates correctly with remaining guesses
  - **Form**: Test form submission works in browser

- [ ] Comprehensive CI validation
  - **Run**: Full test suite with `pnpm test:ci`
  - **Check**: Vercel deployment succeeds after test fixes
  - **Verify**: PR checks show green status
  - **Ensure**: No regressions in other components
