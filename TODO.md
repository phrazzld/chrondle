# Chrondle TODO

## ✅ DATABASE MIGRATION: 100% COMPLETE!

**CURRENT STATUS**: Production database fully operational with puzzles!

**COMPLETED**:

- ✅ Restored puzzle data from git history (298 years of events)
- ✅ Imported 1821 events to production database
- ✅ Verified 297 years available for puzzle generation
- ✅ App loads successfully with today's puzzle
- ✅ Generated Puzzle #1 for 2025-01-13 (year 2005)
- ✅ Cron job active for daily puzzle generation at midnight UTC

**READY FOR PRODUCTION**: Database migration complete with live puzzle data!

**CAUSE**: Two separate Convex deployments exist:

- **DEV**: `handsome-raccoon-955` ✅ **HAS ALL 239 PUZZLES**
- **PROD**: `fleet-goldfish-183` ❌ **EMPTY DATABASE**

**CURRENT CONFIG**: .env.local points to PRODUCTION (empty) - explains all puzzle loading failures!

### ✅ Database Migration Complete (Events Imported!)

- [x] **Export data from dev deployment (has puzzles):** ✅ Restored from git history

  ```bash
  npx convex export --deployment-name handsome-raccoon-955 --path dev-data-full.zip
  ```

- [x] **Import data to production deployment:** ✅ Imported 1821 events across 298 years

  ```bash
  npx convex import --prod --path dev-data-full.zip
  ```

- [x] **Verify production database has events:** ✅ 298 years available for puzzles

  ```bash
  npx convex run puzzles:getTotalPuzzles --prod
  npx convex data puzzles --prod
  ```

- [x] **Test puzzle loading locally:** ✅ App loads, waiting for puzzle generation

- [x] **Generate puzzles:** ✅ Today's puzzle generated + 297 years available for future puzzles via cron

- [ ] **Deploy to production after puzzles are generated**

## 🔥 CRITICAL: Archive Page Server Component Error

**FAILURE MODE**: Archive page throws Server Components render error in Vercel deployment
**ROOT CAUSE**: Clerk's `currentUser()` throws unhandled exception in Next.js 15 Server Component context
**IMPACT**: Archive page completely broken in production, returns 500 error
**ERROR SIGNATURE**: "An error occurred in the Server Components render" with masked details

### Fix Archive Page Authentication Resilience

- [x] **Isolate Clerk auth call in try-catch with explicit null fallback** (src/app/archive/page.tsx:38-45)

  - Replace basic try-catch with comprehensive error boundary
  - Add explicit `console.log` for debugging auth failures in production
  - Ensure `clerkUser = null` is set in ALL error paths
  - Test with: `throw new Error('test')` before `currentUser()` call to verify fallback

- [x] **Add defensive null checks around getUserByClerkId query** (src/app/archive/page.tsx:53-54)

  - Wrap entire Convex user query in separate try-catch
  - Log specific error: `console.error('[Archive] getUserByClerkId failed:', error)`
  - Continue with `convexUser = null` on ANY exception
  - Prevent cascading failure if Convex query throws

- [x] **Guard getUserCompletedPuzzles with explicit error handling** (src/app/archive/page.tsx:59-64)

  - Only execute if `convexUser` is truthy AND has valid `_id`
  - Wrap in try-catch with fallback to empty Set
  - Log: `console.warn('[Archive] Completed puzzles fetch failed, using empty set')`
  - Test with malformed userId to verify resilience

- [x] **Add request context validation before currentUser()** (src/app/archive/page.tsx:41)

  - Import `headers` from 'next/headers'
  - Check for cookie existence: `headers().get('cookie')`
  - Skip auth if no cookies present (SSG/ISR context)
  - Log: `console.log('[Archive] Request context:', { hasCookies: !!cookies })`

- [x] **Implement auth state telemetry for debugging** (src/app/archive/page.tsx:46-69)

  - Add structured logging object:
    ```typescript
    const authState = {
      hasClerkUser: !!clerkUser,
      hasConvexUser: !!convexUser,
      completedCount: completedPuzzleIds.size,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    };
    console.log("[Archive] Auth state:", authState);
    ```

- [x] **Create fallback UI for auth loading state** (src/app/archive/page.tsx:105-130)

  - Replace completion stats section with conditional render
  - Show skeleton loader if `clerkUser` but no `convexUser` yet
  - Completely hide section if no `clerkUser`
  - Add `suppressHydrationWarning` to dynamic elements

- [x] **Test error recovery with forced failures**

  - Temporarily add `throw new Error()` at each auth point
  - Verify page still renders with public puzzle grid
  - Check console for proper error logging
  - Confirm no 500 errors in any failure mode

- [x] **Add runtime environment detection** (src/app/archive/page.tsx:32)

  - Check `process.env.VERCEL_ENV` for deployment context
  - Log environment: `console.log('[Archive] Running in:', process.env.VERCEL_ENV || 'local')`
  - Use to conditionally enable verbose logging
  - Help diagnose preview vs production differences

- [x] **Implement graceful degradation for Convex connection** (src/app/archive/page.tsx:72-75)

  - Wrap `getArchivePuzzles` in try-catch
  - Return mock data structure on failure:
    ```typescript
    { puzzles: [], totalPages: 0, currentPage: 1, totalCount: 0 }
    ```
  - Show "Archive temporarily unavailable" message
  - Log Convex connection errors separately

- [x] **Add performance timing markers** (entire component)

  - `console.time('[Archive] Auth check')`
  - `console.time('[Archive] Convex queries')`
  - `console.time('[Archive] Total render')`
  - Identify which operation is actually failing

- [ ] **Create integration test for archive resilience**

  - Test with Clerk undefined
  - Test with Convex unavailable
  - Test with malformed user data
  - Verify page always renders something useful

- [x] **Deploy fix to Vercel preview**

  - Commit with message: "fix: make archive page resilient to auth failures"
  - Push to trigger auto-deploy
  - Test /archive route immediately after deploy
  - Check Vercel function logs for error details

- [ ] **Verify fix in production scenarios**
  - Test logged out (no cookies)
  - Test with expired session
  - Test with invalid Clerk token
  - Test with Convex connection timeout
  - Confirm no 500 errors in any case

## 🔥 FIXED: Production Deployment & Runtime Issues

### Convex URL Configuration Mismatch (Blocking Production)

- [x] Fix .env.local Convex URL mismatch ✓ Changed URL to `https://fleet-goldfish-183.convex.cloud` to match prod deployment key

- [x] Set Vercel environment variables using CLI: Run `vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL production` and enter `https://fleet-goldfish-183.convex.cloud`

- [x] Set Vercel Convex deploy key: Run `vercel env add CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY production` and paste value from .env.local (prod:fleet-goldfish-183|...)

- [x] Set Vercel Clerk public key: Run `vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY production` and paste `pk_test_aGVhbHRoeS1kb2UtMjMuY2xlcmsuYWNjb3VudHMuZGV2JA` from .env.local

- [x] Set Vercel Clerk secret key: Run `vercel env add CLERK_SECRET_KEY production` and paste value from .env.local (starts with sk*test*)

### Fix Runtime Warnings & Errors

- [x] Fix getDailyYear() deprecation warning in src/lib/puzzleUtils.ts:24 - Remove call to `getDailyYear()` in `getTodaysPuzzleNumber()`, return 1 as default when no debugYear provided

- [x] Fix HintsDisplay validation warning in src/lib/propValidation.ts:117-118 - Change validation to only warn if `p.events && p.events.length > 0 && p.events.length !== 6` to allow empty arrays during loading

- [x] Fix countdown timer bug in src/lib/utils.ts:35-40 - Replace `midnight.setHours(24, 0, 0, 0)` with proper calculation: `const tomorrow = new Date(now); tomorrow.setDate(tomorrow.getDate() + 1); tomorrow.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);`

- [x] Remove redundant "Game Over" text in src/components/GameLayout.tsx:149-151 - Delete the entire conditional block showing "Game Over. The correct year was..." as this info is already displayed in the celebration UI

### Deployment Verification

- [x] Test local build with production Convex: Run `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://fleet-goldfish-183.convex.cloud pnpm build` to verify build succeeds with prod URL

- [x] Deploy to Vercel preview first: Run `vercel` (no --prod flag) to test deployment before production ✓ https://chrondle-r8f1o7gu5-moomooskycow.vercel.app

- [x] Fix preview deployment configuration error: Added all environment variables to Preview environment

  - ✓ Added NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL to Preview
  - ✓ Added CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY to Preview
  - ✓ Added NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY to Preview
  - ✓ Added CLERK_SECRET_KEY to Preview
  - ✓ New working preview: https://chrondle-15bh98rip-moomooskycow.vercel.app

- [x] **Root cause identified**: Preview deployment failures were due to empty production database, not environment configuration

- [~] **Test preview deployment after database migration:**

  - Verify daily puzzle loads correctly (blocked until migration)
  - Test authentication flow
  - Check archive functionality (blocked until migration)
  - Validate no runtime errors in browser console

- [ ] **Deploy to production**: Run `vercel --prod` only after database migration and preview testing passes

- [x] Create vercel.json: ✓ Created configuration for Convex deployment integration

- [x] Fix providers.tsx error handling: ✓ Now shows helpful UI instead of white screen

## 🎯 Core Features Remaining
