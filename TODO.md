# Chrondle TODO

## üöÄ Current Branch: feat/ui-cleanup-and-fixes

### Branch Status: READY FOR MERGE ‚úÖ

All TASK.md items are complete. This branch successfully implements:

- ‚úÖ Removed Review Hints feature and Sync Indicator
- ‚úÖ Fixed streak counter timezone issues
- ‚úÖ Improved input focus management
- ‚úÖ Transformed settings modal to notification system
- ‚úÖ Implemented Central Time DST scheduling
- ‚úÖ Fixed archive mobile styling

## üéØ Immediate Priorities

### 0. Code Review Follow-ups

- [x] **Fix DST Cron Scheduling Drift**

  - ~~Rework `getUTCHourForCentralMidnight` usage so the Convex cron recomputes daily or schedules both CST/CDT hours~~
  - ~~Add coverage ensuring the daily puzzle job fires at midnight CT across DST transitions~~

- [x] **Restore Hint Review Accessibility**

  - ~~Reintroduce a user path to review past hints (modal or alternative UI)~~
  - ~~Update `ProgressBar` / gameplay affordances to surface the entry point again~~
  - Current UI already surfaces revealed hints in `HintsDisplay`; legacy modal intentionally removed as redundant

- [x] **Harden Service Worker Registration**

  - ~~Ensure registration runs even when `window.load` has already fired by the time the component mounts~~
  - ~~Extend smoke tests to cover registration in both dev and prod toggles~~

- [ ] **Stabilize Notification Permission Flow**

  - Clean up the `setTimeout` in `NotificationModal` so we don't set state after unmount or double-run the completion step
  - Add regression tests for the permission success path (checks timer cleanup and toggleReminders sequencing)

- [ ] **Validate Archive Query Parameters**

  - Clamp and sanitize `page` from `searchParams` before passing to Convex queries; reject negatives / huge values
  - Add coverage for malformed/hostile query params so SSR never forwards invalid pagination data

### 1. Production Readiness Verification

- [ ] **Test Production Authentication Flow**

  - Clerk production keys are configured (`pk_live_`, `sk_live_`)
  - Verify `clerk.chrondle.app` domain works
  - Test Google OAuth in production
  - Confirm user sync to Convex via webhook

- [ ] **Update Documentation**
  - [ ] Mark TASK.md items as complete
  - [ ] Update README with notification system info
  - [ ] Document DST cron scheduling approach

### 2. Critical Security & Performance

- [ ] **Add Rate Limiting to Historical Context API**

  - Risk: OpenRouter cost overruns
  - Location: Convex actions
  - Priority: HIGH

- [ ] **Add Request Timeout (AbortController)**

  - Prevent indefinite hanging in Convex fetch
  - Add to `convex/historicalContext.ts`
  - Priority: HIGH

- [ ] **Replace Console Logging**
  - 60+ console.log/error calls in production code
  - Implement structured logging service
  - Priority: MEDIUM

## üîß Technical Debt

### Testing Gaps

- [ ] **Add Tests for New Features**
  - [ ] Notification system (NotificationModal, useNotifications)
  - [ ] DST utility functions (convex/utils/dst.ts integration)
  - [ ] Service worker registration
  - [ ] Archive mobile responsive behavior

### Code Quality

- [ ] **Component Decomposition**

  - [ ] Split GameTimeline.tsx (311 lines)
  - [ ] Simplify GuessInput component
  - [ ] Extract reusable hooks

- [ ] **Performance Optimizations**
  - [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for archive (large lists)
  - [ ] Memoize expensive sorting operations
  - [ ] Add debouncing to localStorage operations
