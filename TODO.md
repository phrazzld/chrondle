# BC/AD Input Fix Implementation TODO

Generated from TASK.md on 2025-09-03  
**Updated**: 2025-09-07 - Added CI Lighthouse fix tasks

**Goal**: Fix iOS numeric keyboard issue by implementing positive year input + BC/AD toggle

## ðŸš¨ CURRENT STATUS: PR #18 Blocked by CI - Lighthouse CI Failure

**NEW ISSUE (2025-09-07)**: Lighthouse CI failing with 500 error due to missing environment variables in production server.

## URGENT: CI Lighthouse Fix Tasks

### [CI FIX] Infrastructure Configuration Tasks

- [x] **CI-FIX-1: Add environment variables to Lighthouse CI step**

  - Priority: HIGH - Blocking PR merge
  - Time: 5 minutes
  - File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - Add env block to "Run Lighthouse CI" step (lines 181-193):

  ```yaml
  env:
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL: https://fleet-goldfish-183.convex.cloud
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: pk_test_aGVhbHRoeS1kb2UtMjMuY2xlcmsuYWNjb3VudHMuZGV2JA
    LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN }}
  ```

- [x] **CI-FIX-2: Verify environment variable handling**

  - Priority: MEDIUM
  - Time: 10 minutes
  - Test that Next.js reads runtime env vars correctly
  - Confirm no sensitive keys exposed in client bundle

  ```
  Work Log:
  - Found comprehensive env var validation already exists in src/components/providers.tsx
  - Added CI verification step after build to check:
    * NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables are properly embedded in client bundle
    * No sensitive server-side variables are exposed in client code
  - Verification uses grep to scan built JS chunks for variable presence
  - Fails CI if sensitive variables are found in client bundle
  ```

- [x] **CI-FIX-3: Add CI environment documentation**
  - Priority: LOW
  - Time: 5 minutes
  - Document required CI environment variables
  - Add comments in workflow file
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Added comprehensive documentation block at start of build job
  - Documented all required environment variables (Convex, Clerk)
  - Added inline comments explaining purpose of each env var
  - Clarified NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for client-side variables
  - Explained why same vars needed at build time and runtime
  ```

### [CODE FIX] Defensive Code Improvements

- [x] **CODE-FIX-1: Add graceful error handling for missing env vars**

  - Priority: MEDIUM
  - Time: 15 minutes
  - Files: `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/lib/convex.ts`
  - Add startup checks for required environment variables
  - Provide clear error messages instead of 500 errors

  ```
  Work Log:
  - Enhanced src/lib/env.ts with comprehensive validation functions
  - Added validateEnvironment() for checking all required env vars
  - Created getEnvErrorMessage() for context-specific error messages
  - Updated providers.tsx to use new validation system
  - Enhanced API webhook route with graceful error handling
  - Changed 500 errors to 503 (Service Unavailable) when appropriate
  - Added environment detection helpers (isCI, isProduction)
  ```

- [ ] **CODE-FIX-2: Create CI environment detection utility**
  - Priority: LOW
  - Time: 10 minutes
  - Create `src/lib/environment.ts`
  - Detect and log CI environment configuration issues

---

## Previous CI Issue (RESOLVED)

**Problem**: Performance tests were measuring jsdom/React Testing Library performance, not actual application performance. They failed randomly based on CI runner load, not code quality.

**Solution**: âœ… Deleted synthetic performance tests entirely. Replaced with meaningful metrics (bundle size, Lighthouse scores).

## ðŸš¨ NEW CI FAILURE: Hardcoded Deployment IDs (2025-09-07)

**CRITICAL ISSUE**: Build job failing - hardcoded Convex deployment IDs found in client bundle

### [CODE FIX] Remove Hardcoded Deployment IDs from CSP

- [ ] **CI-SEC-1: Replace hardcoded Convex URLs in next.config.ts**

  - Priority: CRITICAL - Blocking PR merge
  - Time: 15 minutes
  - File: `next.config.ts` (line 60)
  - Problem: Hardcoded deployment IDs in CSP header get embedded in client bundle
  - Solution: Build CSP dynamically from environment variables

  ```typescript
  // Add helper function
  const getConvexUrls = () => {
    const convexUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL;
    if (!convexUrl) return "";
    const url = new URL(convexUrl);
    const domain = url.hostname;
    return `wss://${domain} https://${domain}`;
  };

  // Update CSP connect-src
  "connect-src 'self' " + getConvexUrls() + " https://openrouter.ai ...";
  ```

- [ ] **CI-SEC-2: Verify no deployment IDs in build output**

  - Priority: HIGH
  - Time: 5 minutes
  - Run build locally and check chunks don't contain hardcoded IDs
  - Commands:
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    rg "fleet-goldfish-183|handsome-raccoon-955" .next/static/chunks/
    ```

- [ ] **CI-SEC-3: Push and verify CI passes**
  - Priority: HIGH
  - Time: 5 minutes
  - Push changes and confirm all CI checks pass
  - Verify CSP headers still work in dev/prod environments

## Critical Path Items (Must complete in order)

### Foundation Phase

- [x] **CP-1: Create Era Conversion Utilities** - Build core BC/AD conversion logic
  - Success criteria: Bidirectional conversion functions work for all years (-3000 to 2024)
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated complexity: MEDIUM (45-60 min)
  - Files: Create `src/lib/eraUtils.ts`
- [x] **CP-2: Build EraToggle Component** - Create accessible BC/AD toggle control
  - Success criteria: Toggle switches states, announces to screen readers, keyboard accessible
  - Dependencies: CP-1 (era utilities for validation)
  - Estimated complexity: MEDIUM (60-75 min)
  - Files: Create `src/components/ui/EraToggle.tsx`
- [x] **CP-3: Refactor GuessInput Component** - Integrate positive input + era toggle
  - Success criteria: Accepts only positive numbers, era toggle integrated, real-time display works
  - Dependencies: CP-1, CP-2
  - Estimated complexity: COMPLEX (90-120 min)
  - Files: Modify `src/components/GuessInput.tsx`
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Successfully refactored to use positive year + era toggle
  - Integrated EraToggle component with proper layout
  - Added real-time formatted display (e.g., "776 BC")
  - Updated keyboard navigation to respect era bounds
  - Converts UI format to internal negative numbers on submit
  - iOS keyboard issue FIXED - no minus sign needed
  - All existing functionality preserved
  ```

## CRITICAL: CI Performance Test Cleanup (Blocking PR #18)

**Philosophy**: Performance tests should measure user-perceived performance in production, not synthetic operations in test environments. Current tests are measuring jsdom/React Testing Library performance, not actual application performance.

### Immediate Actions (Unblock CI)

- [x] **CI-1: Delete GuessInput.performance.test.tsx** - Remove synthetic DOM performance tests

  - Rationale: Tests measure fireEvent performance in jsdom, not real input latency
  - These tests fail randomly based on CI runner load, not code quality
  - File: `src/components/__tests__/GuessInput.performance.test.tsx`
  - Command: `rm src/components/__tests__/GuessInput.performance.test.tsx`

- [x] **CI-2: Delete eraUtils.performance.test.ts** - Remove micro-benchmark tests

  - Rationale: O(1) operations don't need performance tests, just unit tests
  - CI variance makes microsecond measurements meaningless
  - File: `src/lib/__tests__/eraUtils.performance.test.ts`
  - Command: `rm src/lib/__tests__/eraUtils.performance.test.ts`

- [x] **CI-3: Delete timeline-performance.test.ts** - Remove algorithmic timing tests

  - Rationale: These operations are already fast enough; timing adds no value
  - File: `src/lib/__tests__/timeline-performance.test.ts`
  - Command: `rm src/lib/__tests__/timeline-performance.test.ts`

- [x] **CI-4: Add smoke test for era conversion** - Verify functionality without timing

  - Create `src/lib/__tests__/eraUtils.smoke.test.ts`:

  ```typescript
  test("era conversion handles full range", () => {
    // Just verify it works, don't time it
    expect(convertToInternalYear(776, "BC")).toBe(-776);
    expect(convertFromInternalYear(-776)).toEqual({ year: 776, era: "BC" });
    expect(formatEraYear(1969, "AD")).toBe("1969 AD");
  });
  ```

- [x] **CI-5: Add smoke test for input handling** - Verify GuessInput works without timing
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Created comprehensive smoke test suite with 6 tests
  - Tests cover: input handling, era selection, form submission, disabled states, remaining guesses, keyboard navigation
  - Fixed Vitest assertion patterns (toBeTruthy, getAttribute instead of toBeInTheDocument, toHaveAttribute)
  - All 6 tests passing successfully
  - Completed in ~5 minutes (faster than estimate)
  ```
  - Create `src/components/__tests__/GuessInput.smoke.test.tsx`:
  ```typescript
  test('accepts year input and era selection', async () => {
    render(<GuessInput onGuess={vi.fn()} disabled={false} remainingGuesses={6} />);
    const input = screen.getByRole('textbox');
    await userEvent.type(input, '1969');
    expect(input).toHaveValue('1969');
    // Verify era toggle exists and works
    expect(screen.getByRole('radio', { name: /AD/i })).toBeChecked();
  });
  ```

### Replace with Meaningful Performance Gates

- [x] **CI-6: Create bundle size budget configuration** - Measure what affects load time

  ```
  Work Log:
  - Created .size-limit.json with comprehensive bundle size budgets
  - Configured limits for main bundle (300KB), framework (60KB), and individual chunks
  - Updated CI workflow to enforce size limits with failure on exceed
  - All current bundles well within limits (Total First Load JS: 94.76 KB of 300 KB limit)
  - Added helpful error messages and optimization tips for CI failures
  - Completed in ~5 minutes (faster than 30 min estimate)
  ```

- [x] **CI-7: Add Lighthouse CI for real performance metrics** - Measure actual UX

  ```
  Work Log:
  - Installed @lhci/cli package (0.15.1)
  - Created comprehensive lighthouserc.json configuration
  - Set performance thresholds: 0.9 score, FCP < 1.5s, TTI < 3.5s, LCP < 2.5s
  - Updated both CI workflows (ci.yml and lighthouse.yml)
  - Added helpful error messages for performance failures
  - Configured to run on both main pages (/ and /archive)
  - Completed in ~8 minutes (faster than estimate)
  ```

- [x] **CI-8: Remove NODE_ENV=test from CI workflow** - Prevent confusion with test environment
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Removed NODE_ENV=test from test job in ci.yml
  - Tests will now use process.env.CI for CI detection
  - Completed alongside CI-6 (2 minutes)
  ```

### Future: Real Performance Monitoring (Not blocking)

- [ ] **PERF-1: Add Sentry Performance Monitoring** - Track real user metrics

  - Measure actual P50/P95/P99 input latency in production

  - Alert on performance regressions that affect real users

- [ ] **PERF-2: Create performance dashboard** - Visualize trends

  - Bundle size over time
  - Lighthouse scores per deployment
  - Real user metrics from Sentry

- [ ] **PERF-3: Implement performance budget alerts** - Prevent regressions

## PR Review Fixes (Critical - Must complete before merge)

- [x] **FIX-1: Remove Game Integrity Issue** - Arrow key navigation revealing puzzle info

  ```
  Work Log:
  - Removed adjustYearWithinEra import from GuessInput.tsx
  - Replaced handleKeyDown function with no-op to prevent game integrity violations
  - Removed all arrow key navigation tests (6 tests) from GuessInput.test.tsx
  - Added comments explaining why feature was removed per CLAUDE.md guidelines
  - All tests passing (29/29)
  - Completed in ~5 minutes
  ```

- [ ] **FIX-2: Add setTimeout Cleanup** - Memory leak prevention

  - Location: `src/components/GuessInput.tsx:74`
  - Problem: setTimeout in useEffect without cleanup
  - Solution: Return cleanup function from useEffect
  - Priority: MEDIUM - Could cause memory leaks
  - Estimated: 5 minutes

- [ ] **FIX-3: Fix Type Safety in displayFormatting** - Input validation

  - Location: `src/lib/displayFormatting.ts:80`
  - Problem: Math.abs(year) could mask type issues
  - Solution: Add validation before processing
  - Priority: MEDIUM - Type safety gap
  - Estimated: 10 minutes

- [ ] **FIX-4: Enhance localStorage Exception Handling** - Private browsing support

  - Location: `src/lib/localStorageMigration.ts:28-58`
  - Problem: Could throw in private browsing mode
  - Solution: Wrap in additional try-catch blocks
  - Priority: MEDIUM - Edge case handling
  - Estimated: 10 minutes

- [ ] **FIX-5: Remove Input Mutation in eraUtils** - Avoid side effects
  - Location: `src/lib/eraUtils.ts:24-28`
  - Problem: Mutating year parameter with Math.abs
  - Solution: Return early or throw error instead of mutation
  - Priority: LOW - Code cleanliness
  - Estimated: 5 minutes

## Future Enhancements (BACKLOG.md candidates)

- [ ] Smart era detection based on hint context
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (B/A keys) for power users
- [ ] Era preference memory (remember last selection)
- [ ] Support BCE/CE notation option
- [ ] Internationalization for different calendar systems
- [ ] Visual indication when year is ambiguous (could be BC or AD)

## Implementation Notes

**Key Technical Decisions:**

- Use positive numbers in UI, convert to negative internally for backward compatibility
- Leverage existing Radix UI Switch pattern for consistency
- Maintain all keyboard shortcuts and navigation patterns
- No backend changes required - UI layer handles all conversion

**Performance Testing Lesson (Carmack Principle):**

- Don't measure synthetic operations in test environments
- Performance tests should measure user-perceived metrics in production
- Bundle size and Lighthouse scores are better predictors of UX than micro-benchmarks
- CI runner variance makes timing tests worse than useless - they create false failures

**Success Metrics:**

- Mobile input error rate reduced by 50%+
- No accessibility regressions
- Performance unchanged or improved
- Zero data loss for existing users
