# TODO: Static Puzzle Database Architecture

## Context: Transform Chrondle from Complex Multi-API to Simple Static Lookup

**Objective**: Replace runtime historical event APIs with pre-curated static puzzle database for reliable, fast, identical daily puzzles for all users.

**Philosophy**: Carmack's "Make it work, make it right, make it fast" - ship simple, robust architecture that eliminates runtime complexity and API dependencies.

## Phase 1: Core Static Architecture ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

### Database Infrastructure ‚úÖ

- [x] **Create puzzle data schema**: Design `src/data/puzzles.json` with `meta` object containing version/total_puzzles/date_range and `puzzles` object with year keys mapping to arrays of exactly 6 event strings
- [x] **Remove multi-source dependencies**: Delete imports of `getMultiSourceService`, `getWikidataService`, `getWikipediaService` from `useGameState.ts` and related files  
- [x] **Replace getDailyYear() logic**: Modify `src/lib/gameState.ts` to select from pre-defined list of supported years instead of random 1000-2024 range
- [x] **Create puzzle lookup function**: Add `getPuzzleForYear(year: number): string[]` function that loads from static JSON and returns 6 events for given year
- [x] **Replace initializePuzzle() API calls**: Modify puzzle initialization to use static lookup instead of `getHistoricalEvents()` API calls
- [x] **Add build-time validation**: Create validation script that ensures every puzzle has exactly 6 events, events are 15-200 characters, and no duplicates exist within a year

### Deterministic Selection System ‚úÖ

- [x] **Define supported years array**: Create curated list of ~100 historically significant years with reliable event data (1066, 1215, 1492, 1776, 1945, etc.)
- [x] **Update daily selection algorithm**: Modify `getDailyYear()` to hash date modulo supported years array length instead of full year range
- [x] **Remove fallback complexity**: Eliminate FALLBACK_YEAR, CURATED_YEARS array, and hardcoded event arrays since all years are guaranteed to have puzzles
- [x] **Simplify error handling**: Remove try/catch blocks for API failures and timeout handling in puzzle initialization

### Initial Puzzle Curation ‚úÖ

- [x] **Seed 20 high-quality puzzles**: Manually create puzzles for major historical years (1066, 1215, 1492, 1588, 1776, 1789, 1865, 1914, 1945, 1969, 1989, 2001, etc.) with 6 well-researched events each
- [x] **Validate puzzle quality**: Ensure events are diverse (political, cultural, scientific), engaging, appropriate length, and historically accurate
- [x] **Test daily selection**: Verify that different dates produce different years and all selected years have valid puzzles

---

## Phase 2: Puzzle Database Population (Target: 2 days)

### Bulk Puzzle Generation

- [ ] **Create puzzle generation script**: Build Node.js script that uses existing multi-API system (API Ninjas, Wikidata, Wikipedia) to generate candidate puzzles for target years
- [ ] **Implement event filtering pipeline**: Filter generated events for length (15-200 chars), remove birth/death events, deduplicate similar events, and select most engaging 6 events per year
- [ ] **Add human review workflow**: Create simple CLI tool for reviewing and approving generated puzzles, with options to accept, reject, or manually edit events
- [ ] **Generate 100+ puzzle candidates**: Run generation script against historically significant years from 1000-2024, focusing on years with major political, cultural, and technological events
- [ ] **Review and approve puzzles**: Manually review all generated puzzles for historical accuracy, appropriate difficulty, and gameplay quality

### Quality Assurance

- [ ] **Validate historical accuracy**: Cross-reference events against reliable sources (Encyclopedia Britannica, academic sources) and flag any questionable claims
- [ ] **Test puzzle gameplay**: Manually play-test 20+ random puzzles to ensure difficulty progression and hint quality are appropriate
- [ ] **Ensure global representation**: Verify puzzle set includes events from major world civilizations (European, Asian, African, American) and isn't overly Western-centric
- [ ] **Add source attribution**: Document sources for each event for future fact-checking and verification

---

## Phase 3: Production Deployment (Target: 1 day)

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] **Optimize JSON file size**: Minimize whitespace, use consistent formatting, and verify compressed size is under 500KB for fast loading
- [ ] **Add JSON schema validation**: Create TypeScript interfaces for puzzle data structure and validate JSON matches schema at build time
- [ ] **Test bundle size impact**: Verify adding puzzle JSON doesn't significantly increase Next.js bundle size or initial page load
- [ ] **Configure CDN caching**: Ensure puzzle data gets proper cache headers for fast global distribution via Vercel CDN

### Production Readiness  

- [ ] **Remove debug API calls**: Clean up all remaining multi-API debug logging and remove unused API integration code
- [ ] **Update error handling**: Simplify error states since puzzle lookup should never fail with pre-validated data
- [ ] **Test across date ranges**: Verify daily selection works correctly across past/present/future dates and handles edge cases
- [ ] **Deploy and validate**: Deploy to production and test that daily puzzles load instantly and consistently for all users

---

## Phase 4: Maintenance & Expansion (Ongoing)

### Content Management

- [ ] **Create puzzle addition workflow**: Document process for adding new years/puzzles including research, formatting, and quality review steps
- [ ] **Build admin tooling**: Create simple web interface for viewing puzzle statistics, identifying gaps in coverage, and managing content updates
- [ ] **Monitor puzzle engagement**: Track which historical periods are most/least engaging to users for future content prioritization
- [ ] **Plan expansion strategy**: Design approach for growing from 100 to 500+ puzzles while maintaining quality and avoiding scope creep

### Long-term Improvements

- [ ] **Add themed collections**: Design system for special themed puzzle series (Ancient Civilizations week, Scientific Discoveries month, etc.)
- [ ] **Implement puzzle versioning**: Add capability to update/improve existing puzzles while maintaining daily consistency
- [ ] **Create community feedback loop**: Build mechanism for users to report historical inaccuracies or suggest improvements to existing puzzles
- [ ] **Design scaling architecture**: Plan for potential future needs like multiple difficulty levels, regional puzzle variants, or puzzle archive features

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS FOR EXPANSION**

**Current State**: Production-ready with 20 high-quality puzzles covering all major historical periods

**Phase 2 Options** (when ready to expand):
1. **Option A: Create 80 more puzzles** manually to reach 100 total puzzles (slow but highest quality)
2. **Option B: Build puzzle generation pipeline** to create candidate puzzles from APIs, then human review
3. **Option C: Focus on UI/UX development** and deploy current 20-puzzle system to production first

**Recommended Approach**: Deploy Phase 1 to production immediately, gather user feedback, then decide on expansion strategy based on actual usage patterns and user demand.
