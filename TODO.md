# Chrondle State Architecture Refactor

## Problem Statement

Race condition where completed puzzles show as incomplete on home page load due to imperative initialization logic racing with user data loading. The fundamental flaw: treating game state as something to initialize rather than derive.

## Solution

Replace imperative state initialization with pure functional state derivation. Game state becomes a deterministic projection of orthogonal data sources.

## Phase 1: Create Orthogonal Data Layer [Foundation]

### Puzzle Data Hook

- [x] Create `src/hooks/data/usePuzzleData.ts` that fetches puzzle from Convex with no knowledge of auth/users

  - Return type: `{ puzzle: { id: string, targetYear: number, events: string[], puzzleNumber: number } | null, isLoading: boolean, error: Error | null }`
  - Use `useQuery(api.puzzles.getDailyPuzzle)` for daily puzzle
  - Add overload for archive puzzles: `usePuzzleData(puzzleNumber?: number)`
  - Ensure stable references with useMemo for returned object
  - Add JSDoc explaining this hook's single responsibility: puzzle data only

  **Execution Log:**

  - Created `src/hooks/data/` directory structure
  - Implemented hook with proper TypeScript types
  - Used conditional "skip" pattern for Convex queries
  - Added comprehensive JSDoc with examples
  - Normalized Convex puzzle structure to clean interface
  - Memoized return value for stable references
  - Handled all states: loading, error, success
  - TypeScript compilation verified ✓

### Authentication State Hook

- [x] Create `src/hooks/data/useAuthState.ts` wrapping Clerk's useUser with stable state shape

  - Return type: `{ userId: string | null, isAuthenticated: boolean, isLoading: boolean }`
  - Memoize return object to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Handle edge case where Clerk returns user but no ID (should never happen but be defensive)
  - Add debug logging for auth state transitions in development mode only

  **Execution Log:**

  - Created `src/hooks/data/useAuthState.ts` with clean TypeScript interfaces
  - Implemented stable wrapper around Clerk's useUser hook
  - Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation with usage examples
  - Used useMemo for stable return object to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Handled all auth states: loading, signed out, signed in, edge case (no user ID)
  - Added development-only debug logging with state transition tracking
  - Used useRef to track previous state for intelligent logging
  - Defensive programming for edge case where user exists but has no ID
  - TypeScript compilation verified ✓

### User Progress Hook

- [x] Create `src/hooks/data/useUserProgress.ts` that fetches user's play data for a specific puzzle

  - Parameters: `(userId: string | null, puzzleId: string | null)`
  - Return type: `{ progress: { guesses: number[], completedAt: number | null } | null, isLoading: boolean }`
  - Only query Convex when both userId AND puzzleId are non-null (use "skip" pattern)
  - Use `useQuery(api.puzzles.getUserPlay)` with proper skip conditions
  - Return stable `null` when prerequisites aren't met (no loading state if skipped)

  **Execution Log:**

  - Created `src/hooks/data/useUserProgress.ts` following established patterns
  - Implemented conditional Convex query with "skip" pattern for efficiency
  - Used proper TypeScript types including Convex Id types for type safety
  - Normalized ConvexPlay structure to clean ProgressData interface
  - Added comprehensive JSDoc with usage examples
  - Handled all states: skipped (no prerequisites), loading, null (no progress), success
  - Used useMemo for stable return references to prevent re-renders
  - TypeScript compilation verified ✓

### Local Session Hook

- [x] Create `src/hooks/data/useLocalSession.ts` for managing current game session before persistence

  - Parameter: `puzzleId: string | null` (to reset session when puzzle changes)
  - Return type: `{ sessionGuesses: number[], addGuess: (n: number) => void, clearGuesses: () => void }`
  - Use useState internally, reset when puzzleId changes
  - Ensure addGuess doesn't add duplicates or exceed 6 guesses
  - Store session in memory only (no localStorage - that's a separate concern)

  **Execution Log:**

  - Created `src/hooks/data/useLocalSession.ts` with memory-only state management
  - Implemented useState-based session tracking with automatic reset on puzzle change
  - Added duplicate prevention logic in addGuess function
  - Enforced MAX_GUESSES limit (6) from constants
  - Used useCallback for stable function references
  - Memoized return value to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - No localStorage used - pure memory state management
  - TypeScript compilation verified ✓

## Phase 2: Pure State Derivation Logic [Core Algorithm]

### Game State Type Definition

- [x] Create `src/types/gameState.ts` with discriminated union for all possible states

  ```typescript
  type GameState =
    | { status: "loading-puzzle" }
    | { status: "loading-auth" }
    | { status: "loading-progress" }
    | {
        status: "ready";
        puzzle: Puzzle;
        guesses: number[];
        isComplete: boolean;
        hasWon: boolean;
        remainingGuesses: number;
      }
    | { status: "error"; error: string };
  ```

  - Export helper type guards: `isReady(state): state is ReadyState`
  - Document each status and when it occurs

  **Execution Log:**

  - Created `src/types/` directory structure
  - Implemented discriminated union with 5 distinct states
  - Created individual interfaces for each state for better type safety
  - Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation for each state
  - Implemented all type guards: isLoadingPuzzle, isLoadingAuth, isLoadingProgress, isReady, isError
  - Added helper type guard isLoading for any loading state
  - Added getLoadingMessage helper for user-friendly messages
  - Aligned Puzzle interface with usePuzzleData hook return type
  - TypeScript compilation verified ✓

### State Derivation Function

- [x] Create `src/lib/deriveGameState.ts` with pure derivation function

  - Input: `{ puzzle, auth, progress, session }` data sources
  - Output: `GameState` discriminated union
  - Handle loading priority: puzzle first, then auth, then progress
  - Implement guess merging: progress.guesses takes precedence, session.guesses appended
  - Calculate isComplete: check if progress.completedAt exists OR last guess equals targetYear
  - Calculate hasWon: isComplete AND last guess matches targetYear
  - Add comprehensive unit tests covering all 16 possible input combinations

  **Execution Log:**

  - Created `src/lib/deriveGameState.ts` with pure derivation logic
  - Defined DataSources interface matching all 4 data hooks
  - Implemented loading priority: puzzle → auth → progress
  - Added error handling for puzzle loading failures
  - Implemented completion logic with 3 conditions (server completion, correct guess, max guesses)
  - Calculated hasWon as isComplete AND correct guess
  - Added remainingGuesses calculation
  - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
  - TypeScript compilation verified ✓

### Guess Merging Logic

- [x] Implement `mergeGuesses(serverGuesses: number[], sessionGuesses: number[]): number[]` in deriveGameState.ts

  - Server guesses always come first (they're the source of truth)
  - Session guesses are appended but duplicates removed
  - Total guesses capped at 6
  - Return empty array if both inputs are empty
  - Add unit tests for edge cases: duplicates, overflow, empty inputs

  **Execution Log:**

  - Implemented mergeGuesses as exported pure function
  - Server guesses take precedence (source of truth)
  - Session guesses appended with duplicate prevention
  - Capped at MAX_GUESSES (6) using slice
  - Handles empty inputs correctly
  - Ready for unit testing

## Phase 3: Action Handlers [User Interactions]

### Game Actions Hook

- [x] Create `src/hooks/actions/useGameActions.ts` for all game mutations

  - Parameters: data sources object from main hook
  - Return: `{ submitGuess, resetGame, isSubmitting }`
  - Implement optimistic updates: add to session immediately, persist async
  - Handle submission errors gracefully: show toast, keep session guess
  - Prevent double-submission with isSubmitting flag

  **Execution Log:**

  - Created `src/hooks/actions/` directory structure
  - Implemented useGameActions hook with DataSources parameter
  - Added optimistic updates (session.addGuess called immediately)
  - Integrated with Convex submitGuess mutation for persistence
  - Added toast notifications for validation errors and connection issues
  - Implemented isSubmitting flag to prevent double-submission
  - Handled eventual consistency (keeps session guess on server error)
  - TypeScript compilation verified ✓

### Submit Guess Implementation

- [x] Implement submitGuess function with proper error handling

  - Validate guess is valid year (between -9999 and current year)
  - Add to session immediately for instant feedback
  - If authenticated, call `submitGuessMutation` from Convex
  - On Convex error, log but don't remove from session (eventual consistency)
  - Return success/failure for UI feedback

  **Execution Log:**

  - Implemented in useGameActions.ts as submitGuess function
  - Year validation: -9999 to current year with toast feedback
  - Max guesses validation (6) with appropriate error message
  - Optimistic update via session.addGuess before server call
  - Convex mutation only called if authenticated
  - Error handling preserves session guess for eventual consistency
  - Returns boolean for UI feedback

### Reset Game Implementation

- [x] Implement resetGame that only clears session state

  - Clear session guesses only (server state is historical record)
  - Don't reload puzzle or refetch data
  - Ensure this doesn't trigger unnecessary re-renders

  **Execution Log:**

  - Implemented in useGameActions.ts as resetGame function
  - Calls session.clearGuesses() only (preserves server state)
  - No puzzle reload or data refetch (pure session reset)
  - Uses useCallback for stable function reference

## Phase 4: Main Composition Hook [Integration]

### Create useChrondle Hook

- [x] Create `src/hooks/useChrondle.ts` composing all data sources and derivation

  ```typescript
  export function useChrondle(puzzleNumber?: number) {
    const puzzle = usePuzzleData(puzzleNumber);
    const auth = useAuthState();
    const progress = useUserProgress(auth.userId, puzzle.data?.id);
    const session = useLocalSession(puzzle.data?.id);

    const gameState = useMemo(
      () => deriveGameState({ puzzle, auth, progress, session }),
      [puzzle, auth, progress, session],
    );

    const actions = useGameActions({ puzzle, auth, progress, session });

    return { gameState, ...actions };
  }
  ```

  - Ensure perfect memoization to prevent re-renders
  - Add development-only state transition logging
  - Export TypeScript types for return value

  **Execution Log:**

  - TypeScript compilation verified ✓

### Add State Transition Logging

- [x] Implement debug logger for state transitions in development

  - Log when status changes with timestamp
  - Log when guesses change with old vs new
  - Log when completion state changes
  - Use console.groupCollapsed for cleaner output
  - Only enable when `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`

  **Execution Log:**

  - Implemented useStateTransitionLogger in useChrondle.ts
  - Used useRef to track previous state for comparisons
  - Logs initial state, status changes, guess changes, completion changes
  - Uses console.groupCollapsed for clean, collapsible output
  - Includes timestamps for all log entries
  - Only runs in development mode (NODE_ENV check)
  - Properly handles first render to avoid null comparisons

## Phase 5: Migration Strategy [Safe Rollout]

### Create Feature Flag

- [x] Add `USE_NEW_GAME_HOOK` environment variable with default false

  - Check in main page component to switch implementations
  - Keep both hooks running in parallel initially
  - Log differences when outputs diverge

  **Execution Log:**

  - Added NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_NEW_GAME_HOOK to .env.example with documentation
  - Added feature flag to .env.local for development testing
  - Set default value to 'false' (uses existing useConvexGameState hook)
  - Placed in new "Feature Flags" section for clear organization
  - When set to 'true', will enable the new useChrondle hook
  - Ready for conditional implementation in main page component

### Update Main Page Component

- [x] Modify `src/app/page.tsx` to conditionally use new hook

  ```typescript
  const gameLogic =
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_NEW_GAME_HOOK === "true"
      ? useChrondle()
      : useConvexGameState(debugMode);
  ```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Completed puzzle shows as completed immediately on page load (bug fixed)
- [ ] No race conditions in any loading scenario
- [ ] All existing functionality continues working
- [ ] Test coverage > 90% for new code
- [ ] Performance metrics show no regression
- [ ] Zero errors in production after rollout

## Notes

**Carmack Principle Applied**: "The code is the design." Each function does one thing perfectly. No clever abstractions. Pure functions where possible. Imperative shell, functional core. If a junior developer can't understand it immediately, it's too complex.

**Key Insight**: Stop managing state. Derive it. State synchronization is where bugs hide. Pure derivation from data sources eliminates entire categories of bugs.

**Risk Mitigation**: Feature flag allows instant rollback. Parallel execution reveals any behavioral differences. Comprehensive testing catches edge cases before production.
