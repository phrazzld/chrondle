## üö® Critical: Fix Archive Puzzle Crashes

### HintsDisplay Component Interface Mismatch

- [x] Fix HintsDisplay props in `/src/app/archive/puzzle/[id]/page.tsx` (~line 180)

## Task: Fix HintsDisplay Component Interface Mismatch [x]

### Complexity: MEDIUM

### Started: 2025-07-16 10:45

### Completed: 2025-07-16 10:56

### Context Discovery

- HintsDisplay interface found at src/components/HintsDisplay.tsx:16-25
- Current incorrect usage at src/app/archive/puzzle/[id]/page.tsx:225-231
- Required props: events, guesses, targetYear, currentHintIndex, isGameComplete, isLoading, error
- All required data available from gameState and existing variables

### Execution Log

[10:45] Found HintsDisplay interface definition
[10:46] Located incorrect prop usage in archive puzzle page
[10:47] Verified all required data is available from gameState
[10:48] Implementing fix with correct props
[10:50] Fixed HintsDisplay props - now using correct interface
[10:52] Fixed useConvexGameState hook call - was passing wrong parameters  
[10:53] Fixed ProximityDisplay, Timeline, GameProgress, GuessInput props
[10:54] Fixed BackgroundAnimation, SettingsModal, LiveAnnouncer props
[10:55] Fixed getGuessDirectionInfo usage - checking direction === "correct"
[10:56] Temporarily disabled HintReviewModal - needs proper implementation

### Approach Decisions

- Fixed all component prop mismatches to match their TypeScript interfaces
- Corrected useConvexGameState call from (targetYear, true, key) to (false, targetYear)
- Added null safety for puzzle?.events
- Temporarily disabled HintReviewModal as it needs different implementation

### Learnings

- Archive page was using outdated component APIs from earlier implementation
- useConvexGameState takes (debugMode, archiveYear) not arbitrary parameters
- Components have evolved but archive page wasn't updated
- HintReviewModal is designed for single hint review, not bulk review

  ```typescript
  // WRONG (current):
  <HintsDisplay
    currentHint={puzzle.events[currentHintIndex]}
    hintIndex={currentHintIndex}
    maxHints={puzzle.events.length}
    showAllHints={isGameComplete}
    allHints={puzzle.events}
  />

  // CORRECT (required):
  <HintsDisplay
    events={gameState.puzzle?.events || []}
    guesses={gameState.guesses}
    targetYear={gameState.puzzle?.year || 0}
    currentHintIndex={gameState.currentHintIndex}
    isGameComplete={gameState.isGameOver || hasWon}
    isLoading={isLoading}
    error={error}
  />
  ```

### Next.js 15 Async Params

- [ ] ~~Update `/archive/[year]/page.tsx`~~ **NOT SUPPORTED** - We only support homepage, archive grid, and puzzle by ID routes
- [x] Update `/archive/puzzle/[id]/page.tsx`: `{ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }`

## Task: Update archive puzzle page for Next.js 15 async params [x]

### Complexity: SIMPLE

### Started: 2025-07-16 11:00

### Completed: 2025-07-16 11:03

### Context Discovery

- Current structure: Client component with "use client" directive
- Page export wraps client component in error boundary
- Need to handle async params at page level, pass resolved params to client

### Execution Log

[11:00] Found page structure - client component wrapped by page export
[11:01] Implementing async params pattern for Next.js 15
[11:02] Updated interface from ArchivePuzzlePageProps to ArchivePuzzleContentProps
[11:02] Changed component to accept id prop instead of params
[11:03] Updated page export to async function with params: Promise<{ id: string }>
[11:03] TypeScript compilation successful - only unrelated error remains

### Approach Decisions

- Split params handling: async at page level, resolved params passed to client component
- Clean interface separation between page and content component

### Learnings

- Next.js 15 async params work with client components by handling at page level
- Page component can be async while child components remain client-side

### AppHeader Hydration Mismatch

- [ ] Investigate Button component with `asChild` prop rendering differently on server/client
- [ ] Check archive button in AppHeader (~line 92-100) for conditional rendering issues

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Cleanup

### Archive Route Architecture

- [x] **DECISION**: We do NOT support `/archive/[year]/` routes - only puzzle by ID
- [x] **SUPPORTED ROUTES**:
  - `/` - Homepage with today's puzzle
  - `/archive` - Archive grid showing all puzzles
  - `/archive/puzzle/[id]` - Play specific puzzle by ID (1-based)
- [x] Remove `/archive/[year]/` route entirely to avoid confusion

## Task: Remove unsupported /archive/[year]/ route [x]

### Complexity: SIMPLE

### Started: 2025-07-16 11:05

### Completed: 2025-07-16 11:09

### Context Discovery

- Route marked as NOT SUPPORTED in architecture decisions
- Causing TypeScript errors in Next.js type generation
- Need to remove directory and all files

### Execution Log

[11:05] Found [year] directory with page.tsx file
[11:06] Checked for references to year routes - none found
[11:06] Removing directory and its contents
[11:07] Directory removed successfully
[11:07] TypeScript still showing errors from cached .next types
[11:08] Cleaning .next directory to regenerate types
[11:08] Removed cached types for deleted route
[11:09] TypeScript compilation now successful - no errors!

### Approach Decisions

- Simple removal of unsupported route directory
- Cleaned cached Next.js types to prevent stale errors

### Learnings

- Next.js caches route types in .next/types directory
- Need to clean cached types after removing routes
- No other code references the year-based routes

### Add Type Safety

- [ ] Enable strict TypeScript checking for archive routes
- [ ] Add runtime prop validation for critical components
- [ ] Create tests for component interfaces

## ‚úÖ Completed Archive Features

### Phase 1-8: Core Archive Implementation

- [x] Archive context bar visible above fold
- [x] Archive grid with all 298 puzzles
- [x] Dynamic routes for playing historical puzzles
- [x] Separate localStorage keys for archive games
- [x] Completion tracking with visual indicators
- [x] Error boundaries and loading states
- [x] Strict year validation with user-friendly errors

## üéØ Next Steps

1. ~~**Immediate**: Fix HintsDisplay crash~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
2. ~~**High**: Update to Next.js 15 async params pattern~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
3. ~~**High**: Remove unsupported routes~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
4. **Medium**: Resolve hydration mismatch
5. **Low**: Add type safety and testing

## üìã Testing Checklist

- [ ] Navigate to /archive - grid loads without errors
- [ ] Click any puzzle - loads and plays without crashes
- [ ] Complete an archive puzzle - saves progress correctly
- [ ] Navigate between multiple puzzles - no state pollution
- [ ] Check browser console - zero errors/warnings
- [ ] Verify hydration - no mismatches on page load
