## âœ… Recently Completed

### Migrate to OpenRouter Responses API (Oct 13, 2025)

**Status**: âœ… Complete - 11 commits on `feat/responses-api-migration` branch
**Outcome**: Successfully migrated to Responses API Alpha with comprehensive testing

**Key Results**:

- Reasoning effort="high" + verbosity="high" â†’ richer 350-450 word narratives
- Cost: ~$0.026 per puzzle (+13% for reasoning tokens, acceptable quality tradeoff)
- Testing: 100% event integration, 100% BC/AD compliance, all 500 tests passing
- Docs: Complete API configuration reference in CLAUDE.md and .env.example

**Files Modified**: `convex/actions/historicalContext.ts`, `scripts/test-responses-api.ts`, `.env.example`, `CLAUDE.md`, `TODO.md`, `BACKLOG.md`

**Next Step**: Merge `feat/responses-api-migration` to `master`

### Fix Streak Persistence System - Security Fixes (Oct 9, 2025)

**Status**: âœ… Complete - Merged in PR #34
**Outcome**: Closed critical security vulnerability in anonymous streak validation

**Key Protections**:

- Date format and plausibility validation (ISO YYYY-MM-DD, not future, <90 days old)
- Streak count bounds (0-365 days, within 90-day window)
- Streak-to-date consistency verification
- 36 comprehensive security tests covering attack vectors

**What Was Fixed**:

1. Authenticated player loss streak reset (`b4603db`)
2. Streak merge date preservation (`5d49adf`)
3. Multi-day anonymous streak logic (`1021dc2`)
4. Anonymous streak security validation (`1676949`)
5. Equal-length streak tiebreaker (`1541037`)
6. First-time sign-in migration timing (`239258e`)
