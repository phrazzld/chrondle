# TODO: Static Puzzle Database Architecture

## Context: Transform Chrondle from Complex Multi-API to Simple Static Lookup

**Objective**: Replace runtime historical event APIs with pre-curated static puzzle database for reliable, fast, identical daily puzzles for all users.

**Philosophy**: Carmack's "Make it work, make it right, make it fast" - ship simple, robust architecture that eliminates runtime complexity and API dependencies.

**Ready for user testing and production deployment!**

---

## Phase 1: Core Static Architecture ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

### Database Infrastructure ‚úÖ

- [x] **Create puzzle data schema**: Design `src/data/puzzles.json` with `meta` object containing version/total_puzzles/date_range and `puzzles` object with year keys mapping to arrays of exactly 6 event strings
- [x] **Remove multi-source dependencies**: Delete imports of `getMultiSourceService`, `getWikidataService`, `getWikipediaService` from `useGameState.ts` and related files  
- [x] **Replace getDailyYear() logic**: Modify `src/lib/gameState.ts` to select from pre-defined list of supported years instead of random 1000-2024 range
- [x] **Create puzzle lookup function**: Add `getPuzzleForYear(year: number): string[]` function that loads from static JSON and returns 6 events for given year
- [x] **Replace initializePuzzle() API calls**: Modify puzzle initialization to use static lookup instead of `getHistoricalEvents()` API calls
- [x] **Add build-time validation**: Create validation script that ensures every puzzle has exactly 6 events, events are 15-200 characters, and no duplicates exist within a year

### Deterministic Selection System ‚úÖ

- [x] **Define supported years array**: Create curated list of ~100 historically significant years with reliable event data (1066, 1215, 1492, 1776, 1945, etc.)
- [x] **Update daily selection algorithm**: Modify `getDailyYear()` to hash date modulo supported years array length instead of full year range
- [x] **Remove fallback complexity**: Eliminate FALLBACK_YEAR, CURATED_YEARS array, and hardcoded event arrays since all years are guaranteed to have puzzles
- [x] **Simplify error handling**: Remove try/catch blocks for API failures and timeout handling in puzzle initialization

### Initial Puzzle Curation ‚úÖ

- [x] **Seed 20 high-quality puzzles**: Manually create puzzles for major historical years (1066, 1215, 1492, 1588, 1776, 1789, 1865, 1914, 1945, 1969, 1989, 2001, etc.) with 6 well-researched events each
- [x] **Validate puzzle quality**: Ensure events are diverse (political, cultural, scientific), engaging, appropriate length, and historically accurate
- [x] **Test daily selection**: Verify that different dates produce different years and all selected years have valid puzzles

---

## Phase 2: Puzzle Database Population (Target: 2 days)

### Bulk Puzzle Generation

- [ ] **Create puzzle generation script**: Build Node.js script that uses existing multi-API system (API Ninjas, Wikidata, Wikipedia) to generate candidate puzzles for target years
- [ ] **Implement event filtering pipeline**: Filter generated events for length (15-200 chars), remove birth/death events, deduplicate similar events, and select most engaging 6 events per year
- [ ] **Add human review workflow**: Create simple CLI tool for reviewing and approving generated puzzles, with options to accept, reject, or manually edit events
- [ ] **Generate 100+ puzzle candidates**: Run generation script against historically significant years from 1000-2024, focusing on years with major political, cultural, and technological events
- [ ] **Review and approve puzzles**: Manually review all generated puzzles for historical accuracy, appropriate difficulty, and gameplay quality

### Quality Assurance

- [ ] **Validate historical accuracy**: Cross-reference events against reliable sources (Encyclopedia Britannica, academic sources) and flag any questionable claims
- [ ] **Test puzzle gameplay**: Manually play-test 20+ random puzzles to ensure difficulty progression and hint quality are appropriate
- [ ] **Ensure global representation**: Verify puzzle set includes events from major world civilizations (European, Asian, African, American) and isn't overly Western-centric
- [ ] **Add source attribution**: Document sources for each event for future fact-checking and verification

---

## Phase 3: Production Deployment (Target: 1 day)

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] **Optimize JSON file size**: Minimize whitespace, use consistent formatting, and verify compressed size is under 500KB for fast loading
- [ ] **Add JSON schema validation**: Create TypeScript interfaces for puzzle data structure and validate JSON matches schema at build time
- [ ] **Test bundle size impact**: Verify adding puzzle JSON doesn't significantly increase Next.js bundle size or initial page load
- [ ] **Configure CDN caching**: Ensure puzzle data gets proper cache headers for fast global distribution via Vercel CDN

### Production Readiness  

- [ ] **Remove debug API calls**: Clean up all remaining multi-API debug logging and remove unused API integration code
- [ ] **Update error handling**: Simplify error states since puzzle lookup should never fail with pre-validated data
- [ ] **Test across date ranges**: Verify daily selection works correctly across past/present/future dates and handles edge cases
- [ ] **Deploy and validate**: Deploy to production and test that daily puzzles load instantly and consistently for all users

---

## Phase 4: Maintenance & Expansion (Ongoing)

### Content Management

- [ ] **Create puzzle addition workflow**: Document process for adding new years/puzzles including research, formatting, and quality review steps
- [ ] **Build admin tooling**: Create simple web interface for viewing puzzle statistics, identifying gaps in coverage, and managing content updates
- [ ] **Monitor puzzle engagement**: Track which historical periods are most/least engaging to users for future content prioritization
- [ ] **Plan expansion strategy**: Design approach for growing from 100 to 500+ puzzles while maintaining quality and avoiding scope creep

### Long-term Improvements

- [ ] **Add themed collections**: Design system for special themed puzzle series (Ancient Civilizations week, Scientific Discoveries month, etc.)
- [ ] **Implement puzzle versioning**: Add capability to update/improve existing puzzles while maintaining daily consistency
- [ ] **Create community feedback loop**: Build mechanism for users to report historical inaccuracies or suggest improvements to existing puzzles
- [ ] **Design scaling architecture**: Plan for potential future needs like multiple difficulty levels, regional puzzle variants, or puzzle archive features

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS FOR EXPANSION**

**Current State**: Production-ready with 20 high-quality puzzles covering all major historical periods

**Phase 2 Options** (when ready to expand):
1. **Option A: Create 80 more puzzles** manually to reach 100 total puzzles (slow but highest quality)
2. **Option B: Build puzzle generation pipeline** to create candidate puzzles from APIs, then human review
3. **Option C: Focus on UI/UX development** and deploy current 20-puzzle system to production first

**Recommended Approach**: Deploy Phase 1 to production immediately, gather user feedback, then decide on expansion strategy based on actual usage patterns and user demand.

---

**Engineering Philosophy**: Each task is independently implementable with clear success criteria. Prefer simple, testable solutions over complex optimizations. Validate assumptions through user testing and real data. Build comprehensive rollback capabilities for content changes.
