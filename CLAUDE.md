# Claude's Guide to Chrondle

## 🎯 IMPORTANT: How Puzzles Work in Chrondle

**PUZZLES ARE GENERATED DYNAMICALLY - NOT STORED STATICALLY**

The Convex database contains:

- **1,821 historical events** in the `events` table spanning years -776 to 2008
- **6 puzzle records** in the `puzzles` table (for tracking metadata)
- Events are grouped by year and selected deterministically each day

**How Daily Puzzles Work:**

1. Each day, the system uses a deterministic hash of the date to select a year
2. All events from that year are retrieved from the `events` table
3. These events become the hints for that day's puzzle
4. The same date always produces the same puzzle globally

**THIS IS THE INTENDED DESIGN - THE DATABASE IS WORKING CORRECTLY**

- There are NOT 239 pre-stored puzzles that need migration
- Puzzles are generated on-demand from the events table
- The production database has all necessary data

---

## What is Chrondle?

Chrondle is a daily historical guessing game built with Next.js 15, React 19, and TypeScript. Players guess the year of historical events based on progressive hints, similar to Wordle but for historical knowledge. It features:

- **Daily Puzzle Mechanics**: One puzzle per day, globally synchronized using deterministic algorithms
- **Progressive Hint System**: 6 hints per puzzle, ordered from obscure to obvious historical events
- **Convex Backend**: Real-time database with 1,821 historical events spanning years -776 to 2008, generating daily puzzles dynamically
- **Accessibility-First Design**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and mobile-optimized interface
- **User Authentication**: Clerk integration with Convex for progress tracking and streaks

## Your Role

As Claude working on Chrondle, you are responsible for:

1. **Maintaining Game Integrity**: Preserving deterministic daily puzzle mechanics that work globally
2. **Enhancing User Experience**: Improving accessibility, performance, and engagement features
3. **Code Quality**: Following React 19 best practices and TypeScript strict mode patterns
4. **Data Validation**: Ensuring historical accuracy and puzzle data integrity
5. **Developer Experience**: Maintaining clear architecture and comprehensive testing

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Puzzle Integrity Constraint

**DO NOT EVER IMPLEMENT FEATURES THAT REVEAL PUZZLE ANSWERS OUTSIDE THE INTENDED HINT SYSTEM**

### What This Means:

- ✅ **GOOD - Game Hints**: The 6 progressive historical events that help players deduce the year
- ❌ **BAD - UI Hints**: Any UI behavior that changes based on the correct answer
- ❌ **BAD - Smart Suggestions**: Auto-selecting BC/AD, suggesting likely eras, etc.
- ❌ **BAD - Revealing Validation**: Error messages that give away information ("Year too early for AD")

### Examples of Anti-Patterns to Avoid:

1. **Auto-Era Selection**: NEVER automatically change BC/AD based on the year typed
2. **Smart Validation Messages**: Keep errors generic ("Please enter a valid year"), not specific
3. **Predictive Features**: No "likely era" suggestions or intelligent defaults based on input
4. **Context-Aware UI**: UI should not react differently based on proximity to the answer

### Why This Matters:

The entire fun of Chrondle comes from deducing the year based on historical event hints. Any feature that gives away information outside this system undermines the puzzle challenge. Players should figure out if it's BC or AD based on hints like "The construction of the Pyramids" or "The Battle of Waterloo", not from UI behaviors.

## Coding Style & Conventions

### Language-Specific Patterns

**TypeScript Strict Mode:**

```typescript
// ✅ Explicit interface definitions
interface UseGameStateReturn {
  gameState: GameState;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  makeGuess: (guess: number) => void;
  resetGame: () => void;
}

// ✅ Proper null handling
const currentEvent = gameState.puzzle?.events[currentHintIndex] || null;

// ✅ Type-safe constants
export const GAME_CONFIG = {
  MAX_GUESSES: 6,
  MIN_EVENTS_REQUIRED: 6,
} as const;
```

**React 19 Hook Patterns:**

```typescript
// ✅ Derived state with useMemo
const derivedState = useMemo(
  () => ({
    remainingGuesses: GAME_CONFIG.MAX_GUESSES - gameState.guesses.length,
    isGameComplete: gameState.isGameOver || hasWon,
    currentEvent: gameState.puzzle?.events[currentHintIndex] || null,
  }),
  [gameState.guesses, gameState.isGameOver, gameState.puzzle, hasWon],
);

// ✅ Stable callbacks
const makeGuess = useCallback(
  (guess: number) => {
    if (gameState.isGameOver || remainingGuesses <= 0) return;
    // Implementation...
  },
  [gameState.isGameOver, remainingGuesses],
);
```

### Project-Specific Conventions

**File Naming:**

- Components: PascalCase (`GameHeader.tsx`)
- Hooks: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useChrondle.ts`)
- Utilities: camelCase (`puzzleData.ts`)
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE in `constants.ts`

**Import Organization:**

```typescript
// 1. External libraries
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from "react";
import { motion } from "motion";

// 2. Internal utilities and types
import { GameState, createInitialGameState } from "@/lib/gameState";
import { GAME_CONFIG } from "@/lib/constants";

// 3. Components
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
```

**Component Structure:**

```typescript
// ✅ Interface definition
interface ComponentProps {
  required: string;
  optional?: number;
}

// ✅ Component with proper typing
export function Component({ required, optional = defaultValue }: ComponentProps) {
  // Hooks first
  const [state, setState] = useState<StateType>(initialValue);
  const derived = useMemo(() => computeValue(state), [state]);

  // Event handlers
  const handleAction = useCallback(() => {
    // Implementation
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Render
  return (
    <div className="component-styles">
      {/* JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Architecture Guidelines

**Custom Hook Design:**

- Single responsibility principle
- Clear interface with TypeScript
- Encapsulate related state and logic
- Return stable object shapes
- Use useMemo/useCallback for performance

**Component Composition:**

- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use compound component patterns for complex UI
- Leverage Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Implement proper loading and error states

## Common Tasks & Patterns

### Game Logic Development

**Adding New Game Features:**

1. Define types in appropriate interface files
2. Implement core logic in `src/lib/` modules
3. Create custom hook for state management
4. Build UI components with proper accessibility
5. Add comprehensive tests for new behavior

**Modifying Puzzle System:**

```typescript
// ✅ Always validate puzzle data
const isValidPuzzle = (events: string[]): boolean => {
  return events.length >= GAME_CONFIG.MIN_EVENTS_REQUIRED;
};

// ✅ Use deterministic algorithms
const getDailyYear = (debugYear?: string, isDebugMode?: boolean): number => {
  if (isDebugMode && debugYear) return parseInt(debugYear);
  // Deterministic hash-based selection
  const today = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10);
  const dateHash = Math.abs(
    [...today].reduce((a, b) => (a << 5) + a + b.charCodeAt(0), 5381),
  );
  return SUPPORTED_YEARS[dateHash % SUPPORTED_YEARS.length];
};
```

### UI Component Development

**Creating New Components:**

```typescript
// ✅ Use class-variance-authority for variants
const buttonVariants = cva(
  "base-button-styles",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "default-styles",
        destructive: "destructive-styles",
      },
      size: {
        default: "default-size",
        sm: "small-size",
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: "default",
      size: "default",
    },
  }
);

export interface ButtonProps
  extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>,
    VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> {}

export const Button = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
  ({ className, variant, size, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <button
        className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size, className }))}
        ref={ref}
        {...props}
      />
    );
  }
);
```

**Accessibility Implementation:**

```typescript
// ✅ Proper ARIA labels and roles
<button
  aria-label={`Make guess for year ${guess}`}
  aria-describedby="guess-feedback"
  role="button"
  onClick={handleGuess}
>
  Submit Guess
</button>

// ✅ Screen reader announcements
<div
  role="status"
  aria-live="polite"
  aria-atomic="true"
  className="sr-only"
>
  {feedbackMessage}
</div>
```

### State Management Patterns

**Custom Hook Implementation:**

```typescript
export function useCustomHook(): CustomHookReturn {
  // 1. State declarations
  const [state, setState] = useState<StateType>(initialValue);

  // 2. Derived state with useMemo
  const derived = useMemo(() => computeDerived(state), [state]);

  // 3. Effects for side effects
  useEffect(() => {
    // Side effect logic
    return () => {
      // Cleanup
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // 4. Stable callbacks
  const actions = useCallback(
    (params) => {
      // Action implementation
    },
    [dependencies],
  );

  // 5. Return stable interface
  return useMemo(
    () => ({
      state,
      derived,
      actions,
    }),
    [state, derived, actions],
  );
}
```

## Critical Constraints & Requirements

### Technical Constraints

**Package Management:**

- **MUST use pnpm**: npm is blocked via preinstall script
- **No mixed package managers**: Consistent lock file management required
- **Exact versions**: Use pnpm's exact version resolution

**Game Mechanics:**

- **Deterministic daily puzzles**: Same puzzle globally on same date
- **No server dependencies**: All logic must work offline
- **6 hints maximum**: Core constraint of puzzle structure
- **Historical accuracy**: All events must be verifiable

**Performance Requirements:**

- **Sub-100ms puzzle initialization**: Measured in tests
- **Efficient re-renders**: Use useMemo/useCallback appropriately
- **Mobile-first**: Touch interfaces and responsive design
- **Accessibility compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Business Requirements

**Daily Puzzle Workflow:**

- Puzzle selection must be globally consistent
- No ability to "skip ahead" or replay previous days
- Debug mode must not affect production daily sequence
- LocalStorage cleanup to prevent unbounded growth

**User Experience:**

- Progressive hint revelation (obscure → obvious)
- Proximity feedback for year guesses
- Streak tracking and achievements
- Cross-device theme persistence

**Content Guidelines:**

- Historical events only (no fictional or speculative content)
- Appropriate for general audiences
- Multiple cultural perspectives represented
- Factual accuracy verified

### Security Considerations

**Data Integrity:**

- Static puzzle database with validation scripts
- No user-generated content
- No external API dependencies during gameplay
- Secure localStorage handling with error boundaries

**Client-Side Security:**

- No sensitive data in localStorage
- Proper error handling for malformed data
- Debug mode restrictions in production builds
- XSS prevention through React's built-in protections

## Warning Signs & Pitfalls

### Common Mistakes

**Data Modification Errors:**

```typescript
// ❌ NEVER modify puzzles.json directly
// ❌ NEVER skip validation scripts after data changes
// ❌ NEVER change puzzle structure without updating validation

// ✅ Always run validation after any data changes
pnpm validate-puzzles
```

**State Management Issues:**

```typescript
// ❌ Avoid direct state mutations
gameState.guesses.push(newGuess); // Wrong!

// ✅ Use immutable updates
setGameState((prev) => ({
  ...prev,
  guesses: [...prev.guesses, newGuess],
}));
```

**Performance Anti-Patterns:**

```typescript
// ❌ Expensive operations in render
function Component() {
  const expensiveValue = heavyComputation(); // Wrong!
  return <div>{expensiveValue}</div>;
}

// ✅ Memoize expensive computations
function Component() {
  const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => heavyComputation(), [deps]);
  return <div>{expensiveValue}</div>;
}
```

### Anti-Patterns

**Architecture Violations:**

- Bypassing custom hooks and accessing localStorage directly
- Mixing business logic with UI components
- Hardcoding configuration values instead of using constants
- Creating multiple sources of truth for game state

**Development Workflow Issues:**

- Committing debug console.log statements to production
- Skipping quality checks before pushing changes
- Modifying dependencies without understanding implications
- Testing only happy path scenarios

### Performance Considerations

**Critical Performance Areas:**

- Daily puzzle initialization and selection algorithm
- Event sorting and recognizability scoring
- CSS variables resolution and theme switching
- LocalStorage read/write operations during game play

**Optimization Strategies:**

```typescript
// ✅ Memoize expensive sorting operations
const sortedEvents = useMemo(
  () => sortEventsByRecognizability(puzzle?.events || []),
  [puzzle?.events],
);

// ✅ Debounce user interactions
const debouncedGuess = useMemo(() => debounce(makeGuess, 300), [makeGuess]);
```

## Debugging & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Daily Puzzle Problems:**

- **Wrong puzzle loading**: Check date calculation and timezone handling
- **Inconsistent puzzles**: Verify deterministic algorithm hasn't changed
- **Missing puzzle data**: Run validation scripts to check data integrity

**State Management Issues:**

- **Lost game progress**: Check localStorage corruption and error handling
- **Incorrect streak calculation**: Verify date comparison logic
- **Theme not persisting**: Check localStorage and mounting state

**Performance Issues:**

- **Slow puzzle loading**: Profile event sorting and data processing
- **Laggy UI interactions**: Check for unnecessary re-renders
- **Memory leaks**: Verify effect cleanup and object references

### Debugging Tools

**Debug Mode:**

```typescript
// Access debug utilities in browser console
window.chrondle = {
  gameState: currentGameState,
  puzzle: currentPuzzle,
  debugInfo: additionalDebugData,
};

// URL debug parameters
// ?debug=true&year=1969 - Load specific year
// ?debug=true - Enable debug mode for current day
```

**Development Tools:**

```bash
# Performance testing
pnpm test scripts/test-performance.js

# Puzzle validation
pnpm validate-puzzles

# Debug daily selection
pnpm test-debug

# Coverage analysis
pnpm test:coverage
```

**React DevTools:**

- Component profiler for re-render analysis
- Hook state inspection for custom hooks
- Memory leak detection with heap snapshots

### Log Analysis

**Console Output Patterns:**

- Game state transitions and puzzle loading
- Error boundary catches and recovery
- Performance timing for critical operations
- Accessibility warnings and violations

**Production Monitoring:**

- localStorage quota and error rates
- Puzzle loading success/failure metrics
- User interaction performance timing
- Cross-browser compatibility issues

## Testing & Validation

### Test Structure

**Unit Tests:**

```typescript
// Component testing with React Testing Library
test('should display current hint', () => {
  render(<HintsDisplay currentHint="Test event" hintIndex={0} />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Test event')).toBeInTheDocument();
});

// Hook testing with renderHook
test('should calculate remaining guesses correctly', () => {
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useChrondle());
  expect(result.current.gameState.status === 'ready' && result.current.gameState.remainingGuesses).toBe(6);
});
```

**Integration Tests:**

```typescript
// Game flow testing
test('complete game workflow', async () => {
  render(<ChronldeGame />);

  // Make guesses and verify feedback
  const input = screen.getByLabelText('Year guess');
  fireEvent.change(input, { target: { value: '1969' } });
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Submit'));

  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(screen.getByText(/feedback/)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

**Data Validation:**

```bash
# Puzzle integrity validation
node scripts/validate-puzzles.js

# Expected outputs:
# ✓ All years have required number of events
# ✓ Event format is valid
# ✓ Metadata matches actual data
# ✓ No duplicate events within years
```

### Testing Best Practices

**Component Testing:**

- Test user behavior, not implementation details
- Use semantic queries (getByRole, getByLabelText)
- Include accessibility testing
- Test error states and loading conditions

**Game Logic Testing:**

- Test deterministic algorithms with known inputs
- Verify edge cases and boundary conditions
- Test persistence and recovery scenarios
- Include performance benchmarks

**Data Testing:**

- Validate all puzzle data meets requirements
- Test puzzle selection algorithm determinism
- Verify event ordering and scoring logic
- Check historical accuracy and content appropriateness
