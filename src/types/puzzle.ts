/**
 * Canonical Puzzle type definitions for Chrondle
 *
 * This module provides the single source of truth for puzzle data structures.
 * All puzzle-related code should import from this module to ensure type consistency.
 *
 * Design Principles:
 * - Clear, non-overlapping field names (no year vs targetYear confusion)
 * - Strong typing (no string | Id union types)
 * - Aligned with Convex backend schema

 * Canonical Puzzle interface representing a daily historical guessing game.

 * This interface is the single source of truth for puzzle data throughout the application.

 * @property id - Convex ID for the puzzle (always Id<"puzzles">, never string)
 * @property targetYear - The year players need to guess (replaces ambiguous "year" field)
 * @property events - Array of 6 historical events ordered from obscure to obvious
 * @property puzzleNumber - Sequential puzzle number for display and sharing
 *
 * @example
 * const puzzle: Puzzle = {
 *   id: "j97h5s1g4m9n8b7c6d5e4f3g2h1" as Id<"puzzles">,
 *   targetYear: 1969,
 *   events: [
 *     "The Stonewall riots began in New York City",
 *     "Woodstock music festival took place",
 *     "Neil Armstrong walked on the moon"
